					<strong>What is a flashmob?</strong><br/>
					A flashmob happens when a group of people at the same location simultaneously let their phone or camera flash go, creating an explosion of light that is as bright as the number of people attending.  Flashmobs have happened in the past, perhaps you remember the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl16dI0sNEI" title="Robbie Williams flashmob">Robbie Williams flashmob</a> that he organised at his concert in Knebworth in 2003.  In fact Nikon featured this flashmob in a recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxa2ZCWlZjQ" title="Nikon television advertising campaign">television advertising campaign</a>.

				<p>We think that flashmobs are going to become the next big thing now that we've created the Flashmobs app.  The Flashmobs app allows you to create any number of events at any location which you can advertise through Facebook.  If you have the Flashmob app. you will be able to browse events based on your settings and you will be notified of new events that are created that are with your location settings.  Watch the popularity of your flashmob rise as more and more people join your event.  Then when the flashmob is about to happen everyone will be automatically notified that the flashmob is about to take place.  Raise your arms everybody and the flash will automatically go off at the designated time.  Don't forget to have your video camera on so you can record the event!</p>
				<p>FlashMobs is an exciting mobile application that allows you to easily and conveniently organise and co-ordinate a FlashMob event anywhere in the world.</p>
				<p>Please be aware that Flashmobs is a new app. and there is still much for us to do.  We want a version of this app. for all type of phones,  we want you to share your flashmobs through all social networks and we also want you to be able to post your videos directly onto Flashmobs so that others can browse past flashmobs and watch them.  This will take time but in the mean time get Flashmobbing and if you would like to let us know about your experience please contact us on <a href="mailto:flashmobs@absoluteorange.com" title="flashmobs@absoluteorange.com">flashmobs@absoluteorange.com</a>.  Have fun out there.</p>
