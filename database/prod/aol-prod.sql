With the recent interest in HTML 5 I thought it timely to investigate whether I should be implementing HTML 5 on my website.</p>\n<p>Most XHTML web pages (including BBC, Times Online and Facebook) are effectively not XML on the web because they are being parsed as HTML not XML.  This is because they generally use a MIME content type of \'text/html\' as opposed to \'application/xhtml+xml\'; browsers use MIME type to distinguish between two types of syntax to represent HTML documents namely, HTML serialisation and XML serialisation.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for parsing XHTML pages as HTML and not XML makes sense.  Whilst the DTD\'s for HTML and XHTML are both based on SGML, XHTML is a more restrictive subset of SGML meaning that it has very strict syntax rules.  An XML parser will stop processing an invalid page and nothing except an error message will be displayed.  An HTML parser on the other hand is much more complex and lenient.  It uses an error-correcting tag soup parser to display an invalid page to the best of its ability.</p>\n<p>In reality the interoperability of the Web means that invalid pages are a reality; content feeds, user generated content, body content (CMS), trackbacks, ad services and widgets can all create invalid pages.  By using an HTML parser the page is displayed regardless of its well-formedness.</p>\n<p>The XHMTL 2.0 specification has been in progress since 2001 and is in its eighth public working draft.  It is based solely on XML and is driven by how markup should be used, rather than how markup is currently being used.  It proposes sophisticated and elegant solutions that may also  require a learning curve and it is not backward compatible with XHTML 1.0.</p>\n<p>The proposed XForms, which replaces forms in the XHTML 2.0 specification, was the catalyst for the current HTML 5 specification.  In late 2003 Opera intended to prove that it was possible to extend HTML 4\'s forms to provide many of the introduced features of XForms 1.0 without requiring browsers to implement rendering machines incompatible with existing HTML.  The draft proposal, presented jointly by Mozilla and Opera, was rejected by the W3C on the grounds that it conflicted with the previously chosen direction for the Web\'s evolution.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, Apple, Mozilla and Opera announced their intention to continue working on the effort under the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).  In 2006 the W3C expressed interest in the specification, and created an HTML Working Group to work with the WHATWG on the development of the HTML 5 specification.</p>\n<p>Whilst the HTML 5 specification aims to be backwards compatible with HTML4.0 and XHTML 1.0 this hasn\'t been achieved completely as some elements have new meanings.  The specification focuses on creating a language for web applications as well as the creation of API\'s that improve the client side web development environment.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed API\'s which include a 2D drawing API, a video and audio API, an offline web application API, an API that allows web applications to register themselves for certain protocols or MIME types, an editing API, a drag and drop API, network API\'s and a cross document messaging API will no doubt prove most useful to web developers and is certainly a highlight of HMTL 5 for me.</p>\n<p>Over and above that the HTML 5 specification has overwhelming industry support from browsers, search engines, CMS\'s and authoring tools.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the notion that all documents on the web should be written in an XML format is an ideal one.  Ian Hickson in a conversation about the HTML 5 specification stated that the HTML 5 specification came about because 95% of the Web today is HTML.  He also questioned whether the web would have been successful if it showed error messages whenever something was the least bit wrong.  Ian estimated that 93% of documents on the web have markup errors which would mean that over 90% of the web could not be browsed.</p>\n<p>Neither specification has been implemented in its entirety and the HTML 5 specification looks unlikely to reach its deadline of 2010.  Saying that the &lt;canvas&gt; feature has been widely implemented and with such industry support implementation of some sections may take place sooner.</p>\n<p>Since the XHTML 2.0 specification is not backwards compatible with XHTML 1.0 I am going to embrace the HTML 5 specification until the XHTML 2.0 specification gets implemented.</p>',NULL,NULL,'2009-05-11 00:00:00'),(4,'HTML replacement text','HTML replacement text',NULL,'<p>When deciding how to best insert rich typography into my web pages I implemented 4 technologies namely sIFR, server-side installed fonts, TypeSelect and Cufón which I have reviewed below:</p>\n<h3>sIFR</h3>\n<p>sIFR stands for Scalable Inman Flash Replacement and is an ongoing development on the invention made by Shaun Inman in 2003.   sIFR uses JavaScript and the Document Object Model to replace all designated text with Flash rendered text.</p>\n<h4>Advantages</h4>\n<ol>\n<li> Fairly easy to implement</li>\n<li> Degrades gracefully</li>\n<li> Accessible</li>\n\n<li> Search engine friendly</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Disadvantages</h4>\n<ol>\n<li> Requires a Macromedia Flash plugin</li>\n<li> Requires Macromedia Flash software to create the font file</li>\n<li> Online documentation is extremely fragmented</li>\n<li> Can slow the loading of the web page if used frequently on a web page</li>\n\n<li> Requires  careful tweaking of the CSS font size to get the the desired size</li>\n<li> Overestimates the number of lines required to fit the text which occasionally  leaves the text with a blank line below</li>\n<li> Does not handle hover states as defined in the CSS</li>\n<li> Does not handle customisation of text eg. drop shadows</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Server side fonts</h3>\n<p>Server side fonts require font file(s) to be uploaded to the server.

I wanted the lists to use my own list image.  There are two ways to implement this kind of list; use the CSS background-image option or the CSS list-style-image option.</p>\n<h3 class=\"replacement\">Using CSS background-image</h3>\n\n<p>The CSS background-image option is quite popular as it allows complete control over the positioning of the list images.  However, the problem I had with this option, which can be seen in the first screen grab \'List using background image\', is that the list images do not float correctly against div.media.  The CSS relative:position illustrates that the list images are floated left against the holding div.wrapper.  I could find no way to get the list images to float correctly against div.media.</p>\n<h3 class=\"replacement\">Using CSS list-style-image</h3>\n<p>By using the CSS list-style-image with list-style-position:inside, which one can see in the second screen grab \'List using list-style-image\', this works correctly in Firefox i.e. the list images are floating correctly against div.media.  Unfortunately however, IE does not position the list images optionally as can be seen in the third screen grab \'List using list-style-image in IE\'.  I\'ve checked that my list image is a square with no white space on the left.  I could find not way to position the list images correctly in IE. </p>\n<h3 class=\"replacement\">Using CSS list-style-type for IE</h3>\n<p>The best alternative I could come up with for IE is to resort to list-style-type which correctly positions the list images as can be seen in the fourth screen grab, \'List using list-style-type in IE\'.</p>',NULL,NULL,'2009-07-27 00:00:00'),(6,'Developments in CSS','Developments in CSS',NULL,'<p>During a recent contract I came face to face with &#8216;the CSS nightmare&#8217;.  Huge websites with multiple style sheets using complex specificity to assign styles to elements.  The result was inconsistent styles across various sections of the website, lengthy style sheets and more development hours then was necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Realising there was a problem I needed to find a solution.</p>\n<h3>Object oriented CSS</h3>\n<p>Object oriented CSS works in a similar way to Object Oriented Programming (OOP):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In OOP objects have their own class definitions.  In CSS, selectors (element type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, attribute selectors and pseudo-classes) have their own style declarations</li>\n<li>In OOP classes inherit each others methods and properties.  In CSS inheritance and the cascade determine which style declaration should be applied to any given element.\n<p>Inheritance is the means by which, in the absence of any specific declarations applied by the CSS cascade, a property value of an element is obtained from its parent element.  Inheritance is a mechanism that?s separate from the cascade: inheritance applies to the DOM (Document Object Model) tree.</p>\n<p>The cascade deals with the style sheet rules.  The cascade combines the importance, origin, specificity, and source order of the applicable style declarations to determine exactly?and without conflict?which declaration should be applied to any given element.</li>\n<li>In OOP classes can be public or private.  Objects automatically inherit public classes.  In CSS, properties that are not automatically inherited from the parent can be inherited by specifying a value or &#8216;inherit&#8217; for that CSS property, similar to a private class.  Properties that are inherited automatically are similar to public classes.</li>\n\n</ul>\n<h4>Properties that inherit:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>color</li>\n<li>font (and related properties)</li>\n<li>letter-spacing</li>\n<li>line-height</li>\n<li>list-style (and related properties)</li>\n<li>text-align</li>\n<li>text-indent</li>\n\n<li>text-transform</li>\n<li>visibility</li>\n<li>white-space</li>\n<li>word-spacing</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Properties that don&#8217;t inherit:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>background (and related properties)\n<li>border (and related properties)</li>\n<li>display</li>\n\n<li>float and clear</li>\n<li>height and width</li>\n<li>margin (and related properties)</li>\n<li>min- and max-height and -width</li>\n<li>outline</li>\n<li>overflow</li>\n<li>padding (and related properties)</li>\n<li>position (and related properties)</li>\n<li>text-decoration</li>\n\n<li>vertical-align</li>\n<li>z-index</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The concept of object oriented CSS is noteworthy.  The principles of the reuse of styles and inheritance / cascade are fundamental in creating an optimal CSS.</p>\n<h3>Semantic naming of classes and IDs</h3>\n<p>The semantic naming of classes and IDs is a controversial one.  This concept requires that all classes and IDs be named according to their meaning or role within a web page.  Unfortunately only web developers, designers and author benefit from semantically named classes and IDs.  Web page browsers, screen readers and search engines do not use classes or ID&#8217;s to gain more information about a web page.</p>\n<p>The benefits to web developers, designers and authors are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Semantically named classes and IDs give more meaning to a web page</li>\n\n<li> Semantically named classes and IDs can be stylistically changed in the CSS without having to be renamed in the HTML page</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The disadvantage of semantically naming classes and IDs is that it in some cases there is no  logic in naming it semantically.   Yahoo Grids and Blueprint CSS are both CSS frameworks based on grids and both frameworks name their classes based on their presentation.  For example, Blueprint&#8217;s &lt;div class=?span-24?&gt; relates to a &lt;div&gt; that spans the entire 960px over 24 columns.</p>\n<p>The semantic naming of classes and IDs have their benefits and should be encouraged however, when there is no logical reason to name an element semantically when a name relating to presentation may be more appropriate.  For example, a rounded corner &lt;span&gt; may be named roundedCornerTopLeft.</p>\n\n<h3>How to write your CSS</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Create an element type selectors library<br />Defining the design of all HTML elements during the initial stages of web development ensures that all elements that make up a web page, visually communicate their semantic meaning in relation to each other.  It also sets the basic inheritance properties for elements with no further declarations.</li>\n<li>Define style templates for repeated designs within a web site<br />Defining a style template for repeated designs within a web site ensures that they can be consistently and easily repeated throughout the website.  When defining style templates carefully consider redundancy vs dependency.  Should a style be repeated across different class selectors so that a design change in one does not effect all the others?  Or should they be dependent resulting in a design change affecting all associated elements?   In this case you may also consider using  multiple classes to achieve your design.</li>\n<li>Minimise the use of specific selectors wherever possible and when using them, reference them as specifically as possible.</li>\n<li> Carefully consider the proximity of the cascade</li>\n<li>Always consider progressive enhancement and graceful degradation when styling.  For example if your design has rounded corners use the Mozilla and Webkit rounded corners styles.  However, also consider the best way to implement rounded corners in other browsers as well as a design without rounded corners.</li>\n<li>Remember to check how your page looks with CSS disabled</li>\n\n</ol>',NULL,NULL,'2009-07-01 00:00:00'),(9,'Aria','Aria',NULL,'<p>Two weeks ago I decided to present WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) to my colleagues in our weekly meet.</p>\n<p>Since I had previously read about WAI-ARIA it didn\'t take long for me to understand the theory behind the ARIA specification.  In summary:</p>\n<p>ARIA forms part of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) which succeeds WCAG 1.0 and which are both at working draft level with the W3C. </p>\n<p>It has been developed to address the accessibility problem that occurs when rich interaction semantics are added outside of the markup.  When this happens the markup no longer expresses the information needed to populate accessibility metadata which is then mapped by the browser to the platform accessibility APIs.</p>\n<p>WAI-ARIA provides a framework for providing proper semantics to HTML elements that provide information about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the role of the element within the page and in relation to other elements - the ARIA specification provides an ontology of roles that can be attached to content</li>\n<li>the states and properties of elements which are used to declare important attributes of an element that affect and describe interaction.  These are categorised as widget attributes, live region attributes, drag-and-drop attributes, relationship attributes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The target audience for WAI-ARIA includes user agents, assistive technology, authors who create content, authoring tools and conformance checkers.  The relationship between the user agent, the accessibility API and the assistive technology is best illustrated below:</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n<img title=\"Relationship between user agents and accessibility api\'s\" src=\"http://www.absoluteorange.com/images/blog/user_agent_accessibility_api_relationship.jpg\">\n</div>\n<p>My next step was to implement WAI-ARIA and test it on my Mac accessibility software, Universal Access.</p>\n<p><strong>27th September 2010 : in the mean time I have learnt that ARIA is only supported by screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, Windows Eyes and SAToGo.</strong></p>\n<p>What makes ARIA difficult to implement is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is only partly supported by browsers and accessibility software making it difficult to know which bits to implement.</li>\n<li>It does not validate on standard DTD\'s</li>\n<li>It only has limited support in HTML5.0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite these hurdles I decided that perhaps before I tried to implement WAI-ARIA I should test some real live examples using the accessibility software on my Mac.</p>\n<p>For obvious reasons, the first website I visited was the RNIB (Royal National Institute of the Blind).   Whilst there are some obvious improvements in accessible navigation including the Web Item Rotor and Web Auto Spots, overall I could find no implementation of ARIA on their website.</p>\n<p style=\"text-decoration:line-through;\">I spent the next few hours trying to find real live examples or demonstrations of WAI-ARIA.  I found a few websites which I have referenced below but to be honest either the examples didn\'t work i.e. they weren\'t supported by Safari or Universal Access, or I didn\'t quite grasp the concepts.</p>\n<p>27th September 2010 : Since ARIA is only supported in JAWS, NVDA, Windows Eyes or SAToGo, I would have to test examples using these assistive technologies.  In the mean time I found <a href=\"http://www.accessibleculture.org\" title=\"Accessible Culture\">Accessible Culture</a> who has taken the time to test various ARIA specifications on all supported screen readers.  This is a very useful website.</p>\n<p style=\"text-decoration:line-through;\">In conclusion, the concept of WAI-ARIA is a good one however, it requires a considerable amount of effort to implement and to date has limited support.  Furthermore at the time of writing there are very few examples of ARIA being implemented.

Furthermore, building a new product has many challenges and unknowns.  Whilst using agile is desirable there are a number of risk factors, which include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Changing core requirements<br />\nAgile works very well in managing changes to feature level requirements as long as the core architecture stays stable.  In new product development requirements that affect the core system or its architecture are common.  Having a clear indication of these requirements during the analysis phase of new product development gives development teams the opportunity to prototype these features without risking other development efforts from being rendered useless as changes occur in core requirements.</li> \n\n<li>Unknown technical challenges that have not been verified with a prototype<br />\nFor a new product, the number of unknown technical challenges (ideas that have not been proven to work) is way bigger than for an established product. It is usually necessary to identify these challenges, understand their impact, plan contingencies and prove the ideas sooner than later. If one of these efforts ends up falling in the later phases of agile development, this could have devastating effects on the overall delivery plans for the product.</li> \n\n<li>Incomplete system architecture<br />\nSystem architecture provides guidance and framework to make sure that the individual pieces of a new product are coming together the right way. Not having complete core architecture is like a bunch of people walking on their own paths with a \'hope\' that they are going to meet somewhere.  Agile methodology has provisions for bringing different parts of the project to sync-up together at the end of each phase. Having a framework to assess where the overall project is going and how it can come together is a key to ensure timely delivery of the entire product (especially when the product is being developed for the first time).</li> \n\n<li>Lack of Framework for Continuous Integration<br />\nAgile methodology requires that there be a way to continuously integrate the features being developed. Not having a framework to integrate, test and verify that the features are working together as intended could seriously hurt the project and may make integration effort a whole lot more challenging than it needs to be. [Agile methodology and new product development: four key issues, 2008.

Browser features are detected using a device description repository (DDR) e.g. WURFL and / or client side JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid a flash of unstyled content when a page loads one cannot leave all the browser feature testing to be run on page load.  Ideally a DDR would be used to determine device features before the page is server to the browser.  However, a DDR costs money and this will really depend on the client requirements.</p>\n\n<p>In my <a href=\"/webApp/gallery\" title=\"responsive prototype\">responsive prototype</a> I use a server session to store the browser\'s features.  This requires that when a device visits my website for the first time all browser features are detected and set in the session.</p>\n\n<p>If no session is set, the server serves the basic version of the web page (the one for the LCD).  The web page determines whether a browser supports HTML5 using the hasTheMustard method.  \n\n<h4>hasTheMustard</h4>\n<p>The hasTheMustard is a method used by the BBC to distinguish between browsers that support HTML5 and those that don\'t.  It tests for browser capabilities using JavaScript namely, Document.querySelector, Window.localStorage and Window.addEventListener.  It should be noted however, that Internet Explorer 8 does not support HTML5 but since it represents such a significant market share we cannot exclude it.  Using JavaScript user agent sniffing we provide an exception for IE8 and upwards.</p>\n\n<p>If a browser does not support HTML5 or does not have JavaScript the basic web page is displayed.  For those that do support HTML5 and have JavaScript the browser returns to the server (via AJAX) browser features including screen width, screen height, orientation, mouse or touch capabilities, local storage, geolocation etc.  This data is set in the server session and used to determine what content, CSS and JavaScript is most appropriate for the device.</p>\n\n<h3>Device groups</h3>\n<p>To differentiate between styles for various devices one sets device groups.  To be truly responsive device group breakpoints should not have any gaps and can be as exhaustive as your resources permit.  The challenge here is to define device groups that can use the same design grid.  In my prototype I have defined the following device groups:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Legacy</h4>\n<p>Screen width less than 240px\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Smart</h4>\n<p>Screen width greater and equal to 240px and less than and equal to 640px.  Within this device group I can have a number of breakpoints including 240px, 320px, 480px and 640px.  I use an 8px grid for this device group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Compact</h4>\n<p>Screen width greater than 640px and less than 960px.  I can have a breakpoint of 640px, 800px and 960px.  I use a 30px grid with 10px gutters for this device group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Large</h4>\n<p>Screen width greater than 960px.  I set a 960px limit on my website size and use a 30px grid with 10px gutters for this device group.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n \n<h3>AMD Loaders</h3>\n<p>To further improve performance AMD (asynchronous module definition) loaders enable JavaScript, CSS, text and il8n:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to load in parallel improving the overall speed of a website page</li>\n<li>to encourage a modular structure of scripts based on dependencies which are easily maintainable</li>\n<li>to follow a well defined and standardised approach in keeping with the prospective ES-Harmony migration path</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Adaptive images</h3>\n<p>A responsive website will serve appropriately sized images to a device that optimises download speeds.  I have chosen to implement a method based on Matt Wilcox\' approach that redirects all image requests to a PHP script.  The PHP script determines the required image dimension and either crops the image at run time or requests it from the cache.</p>\n\n<h3>Interesting insights:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The CSS media query for orientation is currently not widely supported for example, it does not work in iPhone 4 (iOS 4.3.3).  As such my thinking is that the orientation of the device is not required so long as I ensure my stylesheets include styles, using width media queries, for any viewport changes.</li>\n<li>Dynamically removing and adding stylesheets with JavaScript puts considerable strain on the browser as documented by Stubbornella.  For this reason, I use AJAX to determine the appropriate stylesheets to include in my web page.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Technologies I have used</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>RequireJS (AMD Loader and JavaScript and CSS optimiser)</li>\n<li>{Less} (Dyanmic style sheet language)</li>\n<li>UseJS (AMD Loader for non-compatible AMD JavaScripts)</li>\n<li>MasonryJS</li>\n<li>Almond (minimal AMD API implementation for optimised builds)</li>\n<li>Apache Ant (compiler)</li>\n<li>CodeIgniter REST API server</li>\n<li>Backbone JS (JavaScript MVC framework)</li>\n</ul>',NULL,NULL,'2012-05-04 17:00:00'),(38,'absolute_orange_website_redesign','Absolute Orange website redesign',NULL,'<p class=\"wrapper-body\">It had been approximately 4 years since I re-designed the Absolute Orange website and it was time to implement a much needed upgrade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wrapper-body\">The website uses its own CMS which I have cobbled together over the last 6 years.  It is written in Codeigniter PHP and I took 2 weeks to rewrite the code and improve the interface. I was impressed by how much I have improved. The code uses considerably more logic, common libraries and consistent methodologies for CRUD events which translates into fewer lines of code which are easy to understand and manage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wrapper-body\">As with all websites there is an initial planning phase. I spent half a day researching:</p>\n<ul class=\"wrapper-body\">\n<li class=\"touch-list\">Absolute Orange website metrics</li>\n<li  class=\"touch-list\">Top 100 digital agencies websites on various devices</li>\n<li  class=\"touch-list\">Freelance web developer websites on various devices</li>\n<li  class=\"touch-list\">General information on freelancing in the IT industry</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wrapper-body\">This research helped me finalise my website content and from here I defined my information architecture.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wrapper-body\">I decided that as the Absolute Orange website does not have a huge amount of content or interaction I would design it to be responsive (automatically responding to different size devices through the use of adaptive images, the implementation of appropriate grids and specified design elements using CSS media queries).  Following the \'mobile first\' methodology I design and build for a legacy mobile first and once the basic mobile website is built I then optimise for modern mobiles, tablets and desktops ensuring that my breakpoints are set where the design breaks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wrapper-body\">Having defined my overall approach I drew wireframes for both the optimised mobile and tablet devices (see examples below) .  I kept my wireframes idealistic in that I did not allow myself to set any limitations on the design and the user experience.  These would provide a blue print for an ideal product and it would be perfectly acceptable to compromise during development if time or resources so required, but the wireframes represented the desirable solution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wrapper-body\">Now that the essential planning phase was complete I could begin to consider the first stage of development.  I intended to develop a legacy version of the mobile site first.  A legacy version of a website exists to ensure an adequate user experience to the LCD (lowest common denominator).  As such I designed all the pages in Photoshop keeping my designs at 175px width in order to ensure an adequate experience for my LCD (see examples below).</p>\n\n<p>Development could begin.  The legacy version of the website uses little, preferably no JavaScript (in fact I use only 1 script, storing the resolution of the device in a cookie for my adaptive images PHP script) and CSS 1 & 2.  It\'s URI\'s are all searchable and crawlable and once tested and released forms the basis from which to optimise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wrapper-body\">Unfortunately it was at this point that I ran out of time and I needed to release a MVP (minimum viable product).  I decided to optimise the legacy mobile website for phones greater than 240px but less than 640px using CSS media queries and CSS 3 transitions and gradients.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that version 2 will be optimise the existing website for devices greater than 640px, implementing my tablet wireframes as best possible without using JavaScript.  Version 3 will probably be when I begin implementing JavaScript, perhaps looking at implementing a one page JavaScript app for devices less than 640px.</p>',NULL,NULL,'2013-04-29 00:00:00'),(39,'FileAPI','HTML5 File API',NULL,'Demonstrates the file API using drop functionality and uploads the file to the server.

In addition, the Gutenberg team has published <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/09/26/an-update-on-gutenberg-tasks/\">a comprehensive guide</a> to the features currently included in the editor.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Users can test Gutenberg right now by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">the plugin</a>, which currently has over 450,000 active installs according to the new <a href=\"https://gutenstats.blog/\">Gutenberg in Numbers</a> site. Along with that, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/reference/faq/\">the Gutenberg Handbook</a> has some very useful information about how to use and develop for the new editor.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building Gutenberg?

One of the primary factors for this change is that Gutenberg is nearly ready to be considered for merging into Core, with the goal to complete the merge in v5.0.<br /></p>\n\n<p>To maintain flexibility in the development process the final timelines are not yet determined, allowing work already done for v4.9.9 to be moved to v5.0 if needed. Ensuring that WordPress is compatible with the upcoming PHP 7.3 release is a high priority for the Core team.

Over 2,000 people attended in person, with hundreds more watching live streams of the sessions.</p>\n\n<p>The WordCamp was a great success with plenty of first-time attendees and new WordPress contributors getting involved in the project and community. Recorded sessions from the 65 speakers at the event will be available on WordPress.tv in the coming weeks. In the meantime, check out the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/wceu/albums\">photos from the event</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/06/16/wordcamp-europe-2019/\">The next WordCamp Europe</a> takes place on June 20-22 2019 in Berlin, Germany. If you’re based in Europe and would like to serve on the organizing team, <a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/06/16/call-wordcamp-europe-2019-organizers/\">fill in the application form</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Updated Roadmap for the New WordPress Content Editor</h2>\n\n<p>During his keynote session at WordCamp Europe, Matt Mullenweg presented <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/mullenweg-on-gutenberg-roll-out-plan/\">an updated roadmap</a> for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a>, the new content editor coming in WordPress 5.0.</p>\n\n<p>While the editor is in rapid development, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/06/21/whats-new-in-gutenberg-21st-june/\">with v3.1 being released this past month</a>, the team is aiming to ship Gutenberg with WordPress Core in August, 2018. This is not set in stone — the release date may shift as development progresses — but this gives the first realistic idea of when we can expect the editor to be released.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to contribute to Gutenberg, read <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/\">the handbook</a>, follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Core team blog</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>WordCamp Incubator Cities Announced</h2>\n\n<p>The WordCamp Incubator program helps spread WordPress to underserved communities by providing organizing support for their first WordCamp. The first iteration of this program ran successfully in 2016 and empowered three cities to start their own WordPress communities.</p>\n\n<p>This year, the Community Team is running the Incubator program again. After receiving applications from 104 communities, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/06/26/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-locations-announcement/\">they have selected</a> Montevideo, Uruguay and Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia to participate in the program. Both cities will receive direct help from experienced WordCamp organizers to run their first-ever WordCamp as a way to help their WordPress community get started.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more about the Incubator program follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\">Community team blog</a>, and join the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>The WordPress community of Spain recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wp_es/status/1004681694660603904\">received an award</a> for being the best open-source community in the country.</li>\n	<li>This month, WordPress reached <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\">the milestone of powering 31% of websites</a>.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://wprig.io/introducing-wprig-wordpress/\">WP Rig</a> is a brand new tool to help WordPress developers build better themes.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://richtabor.com/gutenberg-block-unit-test/\">Block Unit Test</a> is a new plugin to help theme developers prepare for Gutenberg.</li>\n	<li>Near the end of the month, Zac Gordon hosted <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/conference/\">an online conference</a> focused on JavaScript development in WordPress &#8211; the session videos will be available on YouTube soon.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6087\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"\n		\n		\n				\n		\n				\n\n		\n				\n								\n										\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"The Month in WordPress: May 2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/06/the-month-in-wordpress-may-2018/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Jun 2018 09:09:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6065\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:360:\"This month saw two significant milestones in the WordPress community — the 15th anniversary of the project, and GDPR-related privacy tools coming to WordPress Core.

This is a noteworthy occasion for an open-source project like WordPress and one well worth celebrating. To mark the occasion, <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/\">WordPress communities across the world gathered</a> for parties and meetups in honor of the milestone.</p>\n\n<p>Altogether, there were 224 events globally, with <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/about/\">a few more of those still scheduled</a> to take place in some communities — attend one in your area if you can.</p>\n\n<p>If your city doesn’t have a WordPress meetup group, this is a great opportunity to start one! Learn how with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/\">the Meetup Organizer Handbook</a>, and join the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Privacy Tools added to WordPress core</h2>\n\n<p>In light of recent changes to data privacy regulations in the EU, WordPress Core shipped important updates <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-4-9-6-privacy-and-maintenance-release/\">in the v4.9.6 release</a>, giving site owners tools to help them comply with the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is worth noting, however, that WordPress cannot ensure you are compliant — this is still a site owner’s responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>The new privacy tools include a number of features focused on providing privacy and personal data management to all site users — asking commenters for explicit consent to store their details in a cookie, providing site owners with an easy way to publish a Privacy Policy, and providing data export and erasure tools to all site users that can be extended by plugins to allow the handling of data that they introduce.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more about these features and the other updates, read the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/17/4-9-6-update-guide/\">4.9.6 update guide</a>. You can also get involved in contributing to this part of WordPress Core by jumping into the #core-privacy channel in the<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\"> Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and following<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\"> the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Updates to the WordPress.org Privacy Policy</h2>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, WordPress.org itself has received <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/\">an updated Privacy Policy</a> to make clear what is being tracked and how your data is handled. Along with that, a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/cookies/\">Cookie Policy</a> has also been added to explain just what is collected and stored in your browser when using the site.</p>\n\n<p>These policies cover all sites on the WordPress.org network — including WordPress.org, WordPress.net, WordCamp.org, BuddyPress.org, bbPress.org, and other related domains and subdomains. It’s important to note that this does not mean that anything has changed in terms of data storage; rather that these documents clarify what data is stored and how it is handled.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>WordCamp US 2018 has <a href=\"https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/2018/05/29/speak-at-wordcamp-us/\">opened up speaker submissions</a> for the December event.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/05/15/wceu-live-stream-tickets/\">Live stream tickets are now available for WordCamp Europe</a>, happening on June 14-16.</li>\n	<li>Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress Core, is getting ever closer to the final stages with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/18/whats-new-in-gutenberg-18th-may/\">a major update</a> this month.</li>\n	<li>In preparation for Gutenberg, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/43309\">significant work has been done</a> to improve WordPress Core’s build process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6065\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"\n		\n		\n				\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n				\n								\n										\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"WordPress.org Privacy Policy Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-org-privacy-policy-updates/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 25 May 2018 08:06:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"privacy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:325:\"The WordPress.org privacy policy has been updated, hurray!

What a terrible decision to push this during a holiday week&#8230;</p>&mdash; Jennifer Bourn (@jenniferbourn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jenniferbourn/status/1047845139912122368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 4, 2018</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n<p>Historically, WordPress has <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/\">shipped major versions</a> in early to mid December rather than November. Holidays were considered because of the sharp drop-off in volunteer contribution activity. These versions were also part of a rigid and predictable four month schedule to get <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/\">three major releases out per year</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, WordPress 5.0 is no ordinary major release. It will contain Gutenberg and completely revamp the content creation and editing experience. Not to mention, we won&#8217;t know the full extent of plugin and theme compatibility until it&#8217;s installed on millions of sites. </p>\n\n<p>Looking at the proposed release date and <a href=\"https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US</a> taking place on December 7th, it&#8217;s not out of the question to theorize the release occurring before and because of WCUS. It should be noted though that the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-unveils-gutenberg-roadmap-at-wceu-wordpress-agencies-and-product-developers-sprint-to-prepare\">roadmap Matt Mullenweg outlined at WordCamp EU</a> earlier this year originally targeted a late August release.</p>\n\n<p>I think it would be a bummer if WordPress 5.0 was not released before WordCamp US. However, it would be irresponsible as a project leader to force a release for public relations reasons.</p>\n\n<p>As Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-announces-5-0-release-plan-estimates-release-candidate-to-ship-in-november#comment-262936\">commented</a> in a recently published article, he won&#8217;t release WordPress 5.0 until it&#8217;s ready. I don&#8217;t think releasing it to have a big moment on stage would qualify as being ready.</p>\n\n<p>I think there should be consideration in pushing the release date to the beginning of next year. What better way to ring in the new year with a completely new editor in WordPress. It bypasses the holidays concern and allows people to apply all of their focus on making sure 5.0 is rolled out smoothly to sites they manage.</p>\n\n<p>Gutenberg has been in development for more than a year and a half. Since the WordPress release strategy was thrown out the window last year and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/\">deadlines are not arbitrary</a>, what&#8217;s a few more weeks of development and testing before pushing WordPress 5.0 to the public?<br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 Oct 2018 03:09:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: WordPress Theme and Plugin Shops are Pioneering the First Layout Blocks for Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84351\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-and-plugin-shops-are-pioneering-the-first-layout-blocks-for-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5995:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/layout.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/EWENELMHYR\">Jeffrey Betts</a>\n<p>Many WordPress theme shops started out with themes as their only products but over the years have moved into selling plugins that enhance their core products. This came about partially because theming standards evolved to encourage developers to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-theme-developers-are-moving-functionality-into-plugins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">put non-presentational functionality into plugins</a>. For many, the revenue from plugins quickly eclipsed that of their theme products. In the past, theme shops have often partnered with page builder plugins to enhance their users&#8217; capabilities in customizing the themes. This may soon change, as the advent of Gutenberg is bringing new product opportunities to theme and plugin shops shops.</p>\n<p>The first iteration of the new editor focuses on blocks and the post editing experience. After Gutenberg is in core, the project will move on to the second phase &#8211; full site customization. This will venture into page builder type functionality. Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1037843717070057472\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">predicts this phase will happen much faster than phase 1</a>, since all of the infrastructure is already in place. The plugin already has a columns block in beta.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg is scheduled to debut in WordPress 5.0 in November, but site customization functionality won&#8217;t arrive until 2019 at the earliest. In the meantime, plugin developers have been experimenting with various implementations of &#8220;section&#8221; and &#8220;container&#8221; blocks while the Gutenberg team <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4900\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">explores a core container block</a> for phase 2.</p>\n<p>Marie Comet&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/MarieComet/WP-container-block/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Container Block</a> is a fork of the core columns block that offers columns structure, spacing, and backgrounds (with both image and color controls). Felix Arntz recently published a tutorial on how he built a <a href=\"https://felix-arntz.me/blog/building-a-reusable-gutenberg-section-block/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reusable Gutenberg section block</a>. Marc Lacroix created his own <a href=\"https://github.com/marcusig/gutenberg-section-block\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">container block</a>, out of necessity, with capabilities for spacing and background customization.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-03-at-10.26.43-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Section/container blocks are a precursor to using Gutenberg for building more complex layouts. Some of these explorations may inform the Gutenberg team&#8217;s implementation of a core container block in the future.</p>\n<p>A few more full-featured layout blocks are starting to pop up on WordPress.org. Kadence Themes, a theme and plugin shop based in Missoula, Montana, released its <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/kadence-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kadence Blocks &#8211; Gutenberg Page Builder Toolkit</a> at the end of August. The plugin brings the editor closer to delivering the features users expect from popular page builders, such as better control of columns for different screen sizes and a <a href=\"https://themes.kadencethemes.com/ascend-5/row-layout-block/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">row/layout block</a> with controls for padding, backgrounds, alignment, and overlays with gradients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmtjc9lh6zA/\" title=\"View on Instagram\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://instagr.am/p/Bmtjc9lh6zA/media/?size=l\" alt=\"Instagram Photo\" /></a></p>\n<p>A live &#8220;Frontenberg&#8221; style <a href=\"http://demo.kadencethemes.com/kadence-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">demo of Kadence Blocks</a> is available where you can see the plugin&#8217;s options for manipulating page layout.</p>\n<p>Pootlepress, a WordPress plugin and theme shop, has added a new Layouts block to its free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/caxton/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Caxton plugin</a>. The company is one of the earlier Gutenberg adopters in the WooCommerce space with its recent release of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/pootlepress-previews-upcoming-storefront-blocks-plugin-for-woocommerce\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Storefront Blocks</a> plugin.</p>\n<p>Caxton bills itself as a &#8220;page layout plugin&#8221; for Gutenberg. Its layout block allows users to select from a number of preset layouts and then add blocks within those layouts. It supports nesting rows and row backgrounds. A Frontenberg <a href=\"http://demo.caxton.pro/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">demo site</a> gives users the chance to play around with the page builder functionality before installing the plugin.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-vimeo\"></div>\n<p>Until Gutenberg adds core support for more layout capabilities, WordPress may see an influx of these layout blocks that introduce basic page builder functionality. Some of these plugins may need to be refactored once there is more direction for these features in core, but they offer a glimpse of what Gutenberg will bring to site customization. Combined with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-3-9-introduces-reusable-exportable-templates-for-multiple-blocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 3.9&#8217;s reusable, exportable templates for multiple blocks</a>, page layouts will become more portable than ever. In 2019, we may see new sites popping up that enable users and developers to share the layout designs they have created.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 Oct 2018 15:24:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 332 – The WordPress 5.0 Release Cycle Begins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=84436&preview=true&preview_id=84436\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-332-the-wordpress-5-0-release-cycle-begins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2241:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss the headlines making the rounds in the WordPress community.

The official release is targeted for November 19, 2018 with beta 1 expected October 19 and RC 1 released October 30.</p>\n<p>In addition to getting Gutenberg merged into core, the scope for 5.0 includes a few new items that Gary Pendergast outlined in his post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updating the default themes to work well with the block editor, and creating the new Twenty Nineteen theme.</li>\n<li>Creating an upgrade experience to remove the Gutenberg plugin and offer the Classic Editor plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>November 19 is the week of the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., when many are traveling or spending time with friends and family. As this is scheduled during a busy time of year and may have unexpected delays, the release leads have come up with a backup plan that includes a secondary schedule.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We know there is a chance that 5.0 will need additional time, so these dates can slip by up to 8 days if needed,&#8221; Pendergast said. His post proposes an additional timeline that would have 5.0 land in January:</p>\n<p>Secondary RC 1: January 8, 2019</p>\n<p>Secondary Release: January 22, 2019</p>\n<p>&#8220;The current release date is November 19, but it can be pushed as late as November 27 if needed,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;To avoid the numerous holidays from the end of November through to January, we&#8217;ll move the release to January if more time is needed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although the backup timeline should allay concerns about December holidays, if the release is at all delayed, it will run up against the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Should we need to switch to the secondary dates, this will be communicated as soon as we’re aware,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;It’s also important to note that we have some updates for PHP 7.3 compatibility that must be released in 2018 regardless, and we would have a short 4.9.9 release cycle for them if needed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contributors had the opportunity to ask questions of the release leads during today&#8217;s 5.0 kickoff meeting. There was some uncertainty in yesterday&#8217;s announcements about whether 5.0 will ship a new default theme. Matt Mullenweg confirmed that they are aiming to get Twenty Nineteen into 5.0.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the biggest variable though, so if it takes longer we won&#8217;t delay the release for it,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>Twenty Nineteen development will happen on GitHub and contributors can join the discussion in the #core-themes Slack channel where regular meetings will happen.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella posted a technical overview of the integration process for merging the new editor into core. He also laid out a plan for how Gutenberg development will continue in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After WordPress 5.0 is released, the Gutenberg plugin will continue to exist,&#8221; Benguella said. &#8220;Its purpose will be changed to the development and the maintenance of the WordPress npm packages, including the editor itself, and will also serve to develop the second phase (site customization) of the Gutenberg project. Plugin updates will continue to be released during the 5.0 cycle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The PHP part of the plugin won’t be needed anymore, as the plugin will just register new versions of the scripts of the packages to replace the ones already registered by Core.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg confirmed during the dev chat that the team plans to add a link to the Classic Editor plugin in the admin when 5.0 ships. Overall, contributors in attendance seemed excited about the prospect of finally having the new editor in core, despite the ambitious timeline proposed for release.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A big benefit even beyond the user improvements is that plugin and theme developers will be able to truly use it as a base in a way that they can&#8217;t right now as a plugin,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;If previous adoption curves hold true, we&#8217;d be on 10m sites (20x current adoption) by new year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg development has been moving quickly and after it is shipped to millions of WordPress users there are bound to be more issues discovered. Mullenweg said quick point releases may be an option for maintaining the flexibility to introduce fixes and improvements in a timely way for users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since 5.0 will be very tight (just Gutenberg, PHP 7.3, and possibly theme) I am open to having 5.0.x releases that are like the 4.9.x releases that bring in some larger updates or improvements we push off, like servehappy stuff,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg technical lead Matias Ventura has outlined the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/09/26/an-update-on-gutenberg-tasks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tasks remaining on the editor</a>. An updated <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-0/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">schedule for the 5.0 release cycle</a> is now available for the public to follow. Gary Pendergast, who is shepherding the merge, said he expects WordPress 5.1 will be available around March 2019.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Oct 2018 23:23:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Gary: WordPress 5.0 Needs You!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://pento.net/?p=2160\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://pento.net/2018/10/04/wordpress-5-0-needs-you/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6289:\"<p>Yesterday, we started the WordPress 5.0 release cycle with an announcement post.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\" content_cards_card content_cards_domain_make-wordpress-org\">\n			<div class=\"content_cards_image\">\n				<a class=\"content_cards_image_link\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/03/a-plan-for-5-0/\">\n					<img src=\"https://pento.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screen-shot-2018-10-02-at-8.39.21-pm-1.png\" alt=\"A Plan for 5.0\" />				</a>\n		</div>\n	\n	<div class=\"content_cards_title\">\n		<a class=\"content_cards_title_link\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/03/a-plan-for-5-0/\">\n			A Plan for 5.0		</a>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"content_cards_description\">\n		<a class=\"content_cards_description_link\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/03/a-plan-for-5-0/\">\n			<p>Usually during major releases of WordPress, the dedicated release lead chooses a few folks to help them through the time-consuming work of managing an excellent release cycle.

I think I speak for everyone on the leadership team when I say that we all feel the same on this. We want everyone to be able to participate, which will require some cooperation from everyone in the wider WordPress community.</p>\n\n<p>The release post was published as soon as it was written, we wanted to get it out quickly, so everyone could be aware of what&#8217;s going on. Publishing quickly does mean that we&#8217;re still writing the more detailed posts about scope, and timeline, and processes. Instead of publishing a completed plan all at once, we intentionally want to include everyone from the start, and evolve plans as we get feedback.</p>\n\n<p>With no other context, the WordPress 5.0 timeline of &#8220;release candidate in about a month&#8221; would be very short, which is why we&#8217;ve waited until Gutenberg had proved itself before setting a timeline. As we mentioned in the post, WordPress 5.0 will be &#8220;WordPress 4.9.8 + Gutenberg&#8221;. The Gutenberg plugin is <a href=\"https://gutenstats.blog/\">running on nearly 500k sites</a>, and WordPress 4.9.8 is running on millions of sites. For comparison, it&#8217;s considered a well tested major version if we see 20k installs before the final release date. Gutenberg is a bigger change than we&#8217;ve done in the past, so should be held to a higher standard, and I think we can agree that 500k sites is a pretty good test base: it arguably meets, or even exceeds that standard.</p>\n\n<p>We can have a release candidate ready in a month.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg\">Try Gutenberg</a></div>\n\n<p>The Gutenberg core team are currently focussed on finishing off the last few features. The Gutenberg plugin has evolved exceedingly quickly thanks to their work, it&#8217;s moved so much faster than anything we&#8217;ve done in WordPress previously. As we transition to bug fixing, you should expect to see the same rapid improvement.</p>\n\n<p>The block editor&#8217;s backwards compatibility with the classic editor is important, of course, and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor plugin</a> is a part of that: if you have a site that doesn&#8217;t yet work with the block editor, please go ahead and install the plugin. I&#8217;d be happy to see the Classic Editor plugin getting 10 million or more installs, if people need it. That would both show a clear need for the classic interface to be maintained for a long time, and because it&#8217;s the official WordPress plugin for doing it, we can ensure that it&#8217;s maintained for as long as it&#8217;s needed. This isn&#8217;t a new scenario to the WordPress core team, we&#8217;ve been backporting security fixes to WordPress 3.7 for years. We&#8217;re never going to leave site owners out in the cold there, and exactly the same attitude applies to the Classic Editor plugin.</p>\n\n<p>The broader Gutenberg project is a <em>massive</em> change, and WordPress is a big ship to turn.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s going to take years to make this transition, and it&#8217;s okay if WordPress 5.0 isn&#8217;t everything for everyone. There&#8217;ll be a WordPress 5.1, and 5.2, and 5.3, and so on, the block editor will continue to evolve to work for more and more people.</p>\n\n<p>My role in WordPress 5.0 is to &#8220;generally shepherd the merge&#8221;. I&#8217;ve built or guided some of the most complex changes we&#8217;ve made in Core in recent years, and they&#8217;ve all been successful. I don&#8217;t intend to change that record, WordPress 5.0 will only be released when I&#8217;m as confident in it as I was for all of those previous projects.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, I&#8217;m asking everyone in the WordPress community for a little bit of trust, that we&#8217;re all working with the best interests of WordPress at heart. I&#8217;m also asking for a little bit of patience, we&#8217;re only human, we can only type so fast, and we do need to sleep every now and then. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n<p>WordPress 5.0 isn&#8217;t the finish line, it&#8217;s the starter pistol.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://automattic.com/creed/\">This is a marathon, not a sprint</a>, and the goal is to set WordPress up for the next 15 years of evolution. This can only happen one step at a time though, and the best way to get there will be by working together. We can have disagreements, we can have different priorities, and we can still come together to create the future of WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Oct 2018 22:14:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Gary\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: GoDaddy Hires Mike Schroder to Contribute to WordPress Core Full-Time\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84411\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-hires-mike-schroder-to-contribute-to-wordpress-core-full-time\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:986:\"<p><a href=\"https://getsource.net/\">Mike Schroder</a> known at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getsource?lang=en\">GetSource</a> on Twitter and Mike on WordPress&#8217; Slack instance <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/garage/mike-schroder-wordpress-core-contributor/\">is joining Aaron Campbell at GoDaddy</a> to contribute to WordPress full-time. </p>\n\n<p>Since 2011, Schroder has contributed to nearly every version of WordPress.

In some ways 5.0 is already de facto out in the wild, with some forward-looking hosts already installing and activating Gutenberg for new installs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg is leading the release but has designated 11 other leads to head up various focuses, including triage, design, JavaScript packages, REST API, merge process and several other important aspects of the release.</p>\n<p>WordPress users can also expect a new default Twenty Nineteen theme to ship with 5.0. Designer <a href=\"https://www.allancole.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Allan Cole</a> will be leading that project, which involves adapting an existing Gutenberg theme for use as WordPress&#8217; next default theme.</p>\n<p>Last week&#8217;s developer chat left many attendees wondering about the status of WordPress 4.9.9.

The timeline for this major release falls during a busy time of year for many who will be responsible for preparing their products and client sites.

I wear a lot of hats but my favorite one is as a WordPress developer. And I am here to tell you about my journey. It was not easy. There were no shortcuts. I had to crawl my way up every single step of the way. And I still have to, it did not become easier – not by a long shot. But I’ve accepted that in order to succeed I have to take the long way and that is basically two words long – <strong>WORK HARD</strong>.</p>\n<p>When I was young, I wanted to be and do a lot of things. I wanted to be an astronaut, a lawyer, a geophysicist. I wanted a pet unicorn or a tiger or a lion or a snake. I wanted to be the first woman to roam the solar system, I wanted to be a world-renowned author. I never became nor did any of those but I did get a pet snake named Yudi and I have a lot of “pet” unicorns.</p>\n<p>I studied engineering because it was the “IT” course during my time. Did I like it? Let’s just say that I had a lot of fun, a lot of heartaches, a lot of sleepless nights and leave it at that. But if you really want to know &#8211; what I really, really want to be right now is to be a TimeLord STAT, but I digress. I think, the main reason I took that course was because I didn’t want to be with a lot of girls. I didn’t want to compete and I was not really into all that girly-girly stuff. It all changed, by the way. I graduated and took the board – I did not pass. Much to the horror of my engineer dad. I never really wanted to be an engineer so I did not bother taking the board again, instead, I worked in a call center. My first work was as a tech support for Dell computers. I got to tinker with laptops and help seniors fix theirs thousands of miles away and I even got to experience them happily shouting telling me that I do not know what I am doing. Fun times.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I did that for a year and I decided that that was not the life for me nor the life I wanted my daughter to see me in.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So we went back home to Iloilo and had my second job there, this time as a Search Engine Optimization Analyst. Fancy title, but all I did was search Google for stuff and write stuff for Google to digest. My boss’ site was built on WordPress and I created content for him. That was my first contact with WordPress.</p>\n<p>Working in that position for a few months bothered me, I know I am capable of more than just that (I am impatient and hard-headed and can’t keep my mouth shut – the perfect combination). So I read about web development. I didn’t know how to code – give me mathematical equations and I’ll solve it right away but all these HTML, CSS and whatnot were alien to me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But I persevered, I never took a shortcut.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I studied for about a month and decided that I was ready. Plus, I’ve heard about this online job site where you can register to be a freelancer – it was quite new at that time but I gave it a go. If you’ve heard of oDesk (now Upwork), I was one of the first freelancers to join and I had the shirt to prove it. I don’t have the shirt now, but they sent it to me when they ran this contest for the freelancer with the longest work record.</p>\n<p>I applied to one job and one of the requirements was WordPress. I didn’t know WordPress aside from using it as a blog, and I know HTML/CSS (in theory). Lucky me, the client who eventually turned into my longest online friend, took a chance on me. I did not exactly tell him that I did not know WordPress, instead I told him what he wanted to hear – That <strong>I CAN DO IT</strong>. And I did. I worked on designing and developing his website while studying WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And that was when my love affair with WordPress started. I continued to learn and gain experience throughout the years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are <strong>NO SHORTCUTS</strong>. Believe me, I tried looking for one and I failed. In order to succeed, you have to work hard and not take the easy way out. Learn, read, listen – do this every single day for as long as you can.</p>\n<p>Although, my first client never really knew until now that I never had any idea what I was doing when I started working for him, I did get the job done (Dr. T, if you’re reading this – Thank you! I won’t say sorry, because that will denigrate all the things I’ve done and all the things I’ve learned over the years I was working with you). I persevered, I didn’t quit when the going got rough. Plus, WordPress has an amazing community and they are more than willing to help you out if you ever get stuck and I used them as a lifeline more times than I can remember.</p>\n<p>Let me say this again, it was not easy. I went through a lot. Moving forward, all of my clients were from abroad, most of them naturally assumed that I am male because of my name. And I think that contributed to how they were responding to my emails or chat.</p>\n<blockquote><p>They treated me as an equal and responded in a way they wouldn’t had they known I am female.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And once they knew, it was really hard for them to back out since they know that I am capable of getting the job done.</p>\n<p>I was brought up to always question the norm, to not back down simply because I am part of the so-called “weaker gender”. I speak my mind when I have to and when and where I choose to. Working in a male-dominated industry is pretty hard, gender bias is palpable in this industry. Plus, there are not a lot of women developers and that is really sad because without women – computing as we know it would not exist.</p>\n<p>You see, women have a harder time getting into the world of information technology because it has become male-dominated. I have a first-hand experience in this, imagine me – a woman, an Asian and a Filipino at that working in a space where men are the be-all end-all. I will say it again, it was not easy.</p>\n<p>Have you heard about the competence/likeability dilemma? The Heidi/Howard Roizen Case Study concluded that when women exhibit characteristics associated with leaders &#8211; like assertion, authority, and dominant behaviors &#8211; they tend to be disliked. Hence, women cannot be both competent and likeable.</p>\n<p>So according to this study: My competence is inversely proportional to my likeability. Meaning the more competent I am the less my colleagues like me. I may completely and vehemently disagree with this conclusion on a personal level, but there is truth to it. What can we do about this? I guess the first step is to acknowledge that it exists and work from there. But do not just be aware of the problem, acknowledge it and make a conscious effort to see when you are unconsciously adding to the problem and act on it. I don’t have a magic solution, what I can do is help empower girls to realize that they are stronger than they think they are and that they can do more. I did it without any shortcuts, I studied, I persevered, I worked my ass off to get where I am right now and I am not done yet. I still have to study, to preserve and to work every single day.</p>\n<p>My journey doesn’t end here, I still have a ways to go. I will continue to love what I do and I assure you, once you love what you do – you’ll work your ass off to make sure you continue to have and experience the joy of being able to do that thing that you love. Do not let your gender, your race or any of your biases define you. It is not a walk in the park, sure, but you have to always, always do your best to not regret doing something because you think you can’t. The only limit is YOU and nothing or no one else.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: There Are No Shortcuts\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=There%20Are%20No%20Shortcuts&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fthere-are-no-shortcuts%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: There Are No Shortcuts\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fthere-are-no-shortcuts%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fthere-are-no-shortcuts%2F&title=There+Are+No+Shortcuts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: There Are No Shortcuts\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/there-are-no-shortcuts/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/100318-min-150x150.jpg&description=There Are No Shortcuts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: There Are No Shortcuts\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/there-are-no-shortcuts/\" title=\"There Are No Shortcuts\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/there-are-no-shortcuts/\">There Are No Shortcuts</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Oct 2018 00:00:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"JC Palmes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"WPTavern: 5th Annual Hacktoberfest Kicks Off Today, Updated Rules Require 5 Pull Requests to Earn a T-shirt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84309\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"https://wptavern.com/5th-annual-hacktoberfest-kicks-off-today-updated-rules-require-5-pull-requests-to-earn-a-t-shirt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1555:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-10-01-at-5.58.26-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>DigitalOcean, along with GitHub and new partner Twilio, are sponsoring the <a href=\"https://blog.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-is-back-for-year-5/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5th annual Hacktoberfest</a>.

One of the primary factors for this change is that Gutenberg is nearly ready to be considered for merging into Core, with the goal to complete the merge in v5.0.<br /></p>\n\n<p>To maintain flexibility in the development process the final timelines are not yet determined, allowing work already done for v4.9.9 to be moved to v5.0 if needed.

Work on the 5.0 release may be ramping up sooner than expected after yesterday&#8217;s announcement that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-9-release-may-shift-focus-to-php-7-3-compatibility-gutenberg-merge-proposal-timeline-tbd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4.9.9 may be a quick release for PHP 7.3 compatibility</a> or possibly cancelled altogether.</p>\n<p>Themeforest, the largest marketplace for commercial WordPress themes with more than 11,000 products, has a specific <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/tags/gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tag for Gutenberg-compatible theme listings</a>. Searching for themes that mention Gutenberg in the description turns up 139 products. But what does &#8220;Gutenberg compatible&#8221; mean?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-27-at-3.44.38-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg compatibility seems to be more of a buzzword among most of the Themeforest listings, indicating that the theme includes styles for all core blocks. However, in some instances theme authors have also tested shortcodes for compatibility with the new editor. A smaller number include access to premium blocks as part of their advertised Gutenberg compatibility.</p>\n<p>Searching the WordPress.org Theme Directory for &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/search/Gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg</a>&#8221; produces 26 results where compatibility is mentioned in the theme descriptions. Themes are noted to be &#8220;fully compatible&#8221; with Gutenberg or specifically &#8220;designed to work with the new editor.&#8221; There is a wide spectrum of interpretation on those selling points &#8211; from basic styles for core blocks to themes that explore all the possibilities that Gutenberg opens up with features created specifically for manipulation inside the new editor.</p>\n<p>Independent theme shops have been leading the charge in creating themes built to showcase what Gutenberg can do through pairing with plugins that offer block collections. Themes like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/editor-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Editor Blocks</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/atomic-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Atomic Blocks</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/coblocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CoBlocks</a> all have accompanying plugins that add custom blocks. This particular approach of packaging blocks into collections may not last very long, as it tends to make individual blocks more difficult to find.</p>\n<p>At the moment, advertising a theme as &#8220;Gutenberg compatible&#8221; is a temporary marketing strategy, as Gutenberg will soon lose its code name and become simply &#8220;the editor.&#8221; That special distinction will evaporate as soon as WordPress 5.0 lands. Gutenberg support will quickly become a matter of basic WordPress compatibility. The days of using it as a marketable feature are limited, and the pressure is on for theme developers to ensure their products are ready.</p>\n<p>In the video below, an excerpt from the &#8220;Theming with Gutenberg Course,&#8221; Zac Gordon examines considerations for theme developers who are working towards making their products compatible with the new editor. Gordon emphasizes that Gutenberg should work out of the box with any theme. However, there are a few features, such as the full width cover image, that may require special styles in order to work on the front end. The bulk of the compatibility work is ensuring that the editing experience matches the frontend and that Gutenberg blocks are styled harmoniously with the rest of the theme&#8217;s features.</p>\n<p>There are many tutorials available to help theme developers (and agencies preparing client sites) get started with making their themes ready for the Gutenberg era.

The company&#8217;s design team also packaged the algorithm as a web tool called <a href=\"https://www.colorbox.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ColorBox</a>. It makes it easy for anyone to produce color sets with accessible contrast ratios, as outlined in the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WCAG 2.0</a> standards.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We made accessibility a cornerstone of our new color system,&#8221; Lyft designer Kevyn Arnott said. &#8220;We wanted to remove the need to manually check color contrast using third-party tools, and we needed to make it dead-simple for everyone to create accessible products.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Arnott&#8217;s post &#8220;<a href=\"https://design.lyft.com/re-approaching-color-9e604ba22c88\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Re-approaching color</a>&#8221; describes how his team created the algorithm and why it was necessary. As Lyft&#8217;s design and engineering teams grew, it became apparent that color naming and selection was not consistent across their products. With thousands of people building products that rely on color, scaling a color system becomes vitally important.</p>\n<p>Lyft used what they had already done with color naming and selection and created an algorithm that would standardize the progression of lightness-to-darkness across color hues. The result is that every color 0–50 is accessible (4.5:1) on black and every color 60–100 is accessible (4.5:1) on white.</p>\n<p>ColorBox is a mesmerizing and powerful tool to play with. It has inputs for the number of steps, hue, saturation, and luminosity. Each input also comes with different preset curve options, offering greater control over how colors progress in hue and saturation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This algorithm allows us to remove all the dependencies we previously had with color selection, so if we have a new designer working on this or we change tools or monitors, we’ll still have the same outcome,&#8221; Arnott said. &#8220;This algorithm also enables us to quickly modify or scale color as we need to over time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many companies and open source projects seem to be short on accessibility experts, so a tool targeted at making accessible color systems more approachable is a welcome contribution. The <a href=\"https://github.com/lyft/coloralgorithm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript color algorithm</a> is open source on GitHub (Apache 2.0 license) and can be modified for any project&#8217;s specific needs.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:46:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 4.0 RC 1 Will Be Available in A Few Days\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84264\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-4-0-rc-1-will-be-available-in-a-few-days\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2145:\"<p>Matias Ventura, Gutenberg&#8217;s technical lead, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/09/26/an-update-on-gutenberg-tasks/\">published an update</a> on the progress of Gutenberg 4.0 and what users can expect.

Gutenberg 4.0 will initially be a release candidate that will be made available in the next few days. </p>\n\n<p>Due to the &#8220;Try Gutenberg&#8221; callout <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-8-released\">in WordPress 4.9.8</a> and the editor <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-is-slowly-rolling-out-to-wordpress-com-users\">slowly making its way</a> to sites on WordPress.com, the team has received a lot of feedback leading to improved iterations. <br /></p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The main feature set <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4894\">targeted for the first version</a> of the editor has been considered complete for a few releases now,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;Since then, however, the large amount of testing being carried out and the great feedback coming from multiple venues has resulted in several further iterations and additions to continue to improve the overall experience to wider satisfaction.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;This includes things like editor modes and tweaks to the inserter, transformation, and toolbar mechanisms.

Here&#8217;s what we know right now: Discussions are underway regarding making it a quick PHP 7.3 compatibility release or cancelling it in favor of moving ahead with the 5.0 release cycle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Progress and communication on 4.9.9 has been very vague as of late, and I apologize for that,&#8221; WordPress 4.9.9 release co-lead Alain Schlesser said. &#8220;There were things that needed to be clarified first, but we can now finally share the big news with you: It&#8217;s just about time to begin work on the 5.0 release cycle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because of this, @antpb and I will step back as release leads and we&#8217;ll wind down the 4.9.9 release. Over the next couple of weeks we will start coordinating the transition to ease into this major release cycle. This includes going through the hard work that teams are already in the middle of and planning how best to proceed. As we&#8217;ll figure out the next steps and the best path forward, we&#8217;ll share further details in future updates.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After Schlesser&#8217;s announcement, there was some discussion about whether or not 4.9.9 is still needed, but the matter seemed to be already settled. Josepha Haden, who leads the open source teams at Automattic as a full-time sponsored volunteer on the WordPress project, is assisting in transitioning important items from the 4.9.9 release.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we all know that a lot of work has gone into 4.9.9 planning already,&#8221; Haden said. &#8220;So the next couple of weeks will be all about reaching out to team reps and discussing what you&#8217;ve been working on and what we can do to keep things moving forward for everyone. But I will probably be helping with the 4.9.9 transition things, and I will say that the final timelines will almost certainly will be contingent on what I hear from team reps who were collaborating on 4.9.9.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Haden confirmed that Schlesser was sharing the overall plan for the release but that feedback from the discussions indicated there may be items with earlier deadlines to consider. After gathering information from the team representatives, they will work to prioritize items that may need to land before 5.0. There may be time for a tightly-focused 4.9.9 release aimed solely at PHP 7.3 compatibility.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it will be possible to wrangle a small 4.9.9 release with PHP 7.3 related bug fixes, while 5.0 is ramping up,&#8221; Gary Pendergast commented during the meeting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Given a good part of 4.9.9&#8217;s focus was on supporting things for Gutenberg, not sure we &#8216;need a 4.9.9 release if we would just include the work done to support Gutenberg with the Gutenberg merge proposal coming for 5.0,&#8221; Jeff Paul said. Gutenberg technical lead Matias Ventura confirmed that the plugin is ready for the team to begin collaborating on a merge proposal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have kept development in the plugin for as long as possible for speed / convenience, etc, but it’s been ready for starting 5.0 process for a bit,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;From the Gutenberg side, things should be ready to start planning the merge.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At the moment, a quick 4.9.9 release is under consideration for PHP 7.3-related bug fixes. It may happen while the gears are in motion for 5.0 or it may yet be cancelled in favor of going full speed ahead with the 5.0 release cycle. The decision has not yet been officially announced.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 22:29:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"HeroPress: The Hero’s Journey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=2629\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://heropress.com/the-heros-journey/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-heros-journey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3427:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/100516-2-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: We cannot know the end of any journey until we find ourselves there.\" /><p>A couple years ago I noticed that someone had done a talk at WordCamp Brighton called &#8220;<a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2016/08/09/tamsin-taylor-a-heros-journey/\">The Hero&#8217;s Journey</a>&#8220;. As you can imagine it immediately caught my eye and I went hunting to find this cool person.  As it turns out it was Tamsin Taylor from Brighton and she had a great story. As I was re-reading it today I was struck by her point that great things are built from the foundation of many smaller things. Experience comes from years of simply doing. Maturity comes from years of growing. Heroism comes from many small acts of goodness.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a journey involved in every destination. We face hardship, struggle, pain, and growth, and at the end we&#8217;re a different person in a different place. Often we don&#8217;t realize it until someone says &#8220;Wow, you&#8217;re amazing, how did you get so good at that?&#8221; and you realize you&#8217;ve just been doing it so long that it just feels like who you are.</p>\n<p>Find the good things in life and do them over and over until they become who you are.  Also, read Tamsin&#8217;s excellent essay:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/bumpy-journey-becoming/\">The Bumpy Journey of Becoming</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: The Hero&#8217;s Journey\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Hero%27s%20Journey&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fthe-heros-journey%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: The Hero&#8217;s Journey\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fthe-heros-journey%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fthe-heros-journey%2F&title=The+Hero%26%238217%3Bs+Journey\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: The Hero&#8217;s Journey\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/the-heros-journey/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/100516-2-150x150.jpg&description=The Hero\'s Journey\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: The Hero&#8217;s Journey\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/the-heros-journey/\" title=\"The Hero&#8217;s Journey\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/the-heros-journey/\">The Hero&#8217;s Journey</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 14:57:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"WPTavern: Creative Commons Beta Search Tool Adds Access to 13 Content Providers, Improves Metadata with AI Image Tags\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84213\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:127:\"https://wptavern.com/creative-commons-beta-search-tool-adds-access-to-13-content-providers-improves-metadata-with-ai-image-tags\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3609:\"<p>In February 2017, Creative Commons <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/creative-commons-new-search-tool-is-now-in-beta-pulls-cc-images-from-multiple-sources\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">launched the beta version</a> of its new <a href=\"https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">multi-source search tool</a>, built on a lean budget by a single contractor over seven months. Since that time a new tech team has taken over the project to further the mission of finding and indexing all 1.4 billion+ CC-licensed works on the web.</p>\n<p>The first iteration added access to images from Rijksmuseum, Flickr, 500px, the New York Public Library, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Today&#8217;s <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2018/09/24/big-changes-for-cc-search-beta-updates-released-today/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">update</a> to the search tool adds access to more than 10 million images and a total of 13 content providers, including Behance, Geograph UK, IHA Holiday Ads, several other museums, and a handful of smaller sources.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/screencapture-ccsearch-creativecommons.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>The search page is also sporting a new design, featuring Creative Commons&#8217; top categories and top images.</p>\n<p>Previously, search results were displayed as a masonry style grid, supporting images of varying sizes and orientations. The updated results are displayed as a slice of a landscape-oriented image on mobile and desktop, which is not optimal for seeing what the image is without clicking on it. This doesn&#8217;t seem like an improvement, but the search tool&#8217;s development team is still working through bugs and the site is in active development.</p>\n<p>This update to the search tool also adds AI image tags generated by <a href=\"https://clarifai.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Clarifai</a>&#8216;s image classification system. More than 10.3 million images have been tagged using the image recognition software, in addition to the user-defined and platform-defined tags gathered from web crawl data. This should make the search results more accurate for users in the future.</p>\n<p>Lists and collections were a feature of the first beta but private lists are no longer available in the beta update. (Users can request they be manually retrieved by emailing Creative Commons.) The feature has been updated to allow users to create public lists of images without having an account. A new shares.cc link shortening system is now available for sharing images and lists.</p>\n<p>The Creative Commons library is an excellent resource for finding images for blogging or for use in WordPress theme and plugin development. Images that are CC0-licensed are GPL-compatible for use within WordPress products. Creative Commons has a recommended implementation for <a href=\"https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_FAQ#May_I_apply_CC0_to_computer_software.3F_If_so.2C_is_there_a_recommended_implementation.3F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">using CC0 to release software</a>.</p>\n<p>A WordPress plugin for bringing images in from the Creative Commons library does not yet exist but there are many that pull CC-licensed images from resources like Flickr or Pixabay. For now, users will need to search directly on the <a href=\"https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons beta search</a> website. The new search tool allows users to filter by collection, license, and license type.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 23:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 3.9 Introduces Reusable, Exportable Templates for Multiple Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84179\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-3-9-introduces-reusable-exportable-templates-for-multiple-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3107:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/09/21/whats-new-in-gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 3.9</a> was released last week with a new feature that allows users to group multiple blocks into reusable templates. The templates can also be exported and imported as a JSON file.</p>\n<p>The idea of reusable templates is an expansion of the concept of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/1516\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dynamic reusable blocks</a> that Gutenberg technical lead Matias Ventura proposed in June 2017. Reusability is even more powerful when applied to multiple blocks. The import/export capabilities make it possible for templates to be easily shared across WordPress sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-24-at-1.04.36-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>If you want to test it, you can select multiple blocks by selecting the content inside a block and dragging outside the boundaries of the block to extend the selection to multiple blocks. The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/62\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">multi-select feature</a> was originally added for the purpose of deleting or moving multiple blocks but it has now become indispensable for creating reusable templates.</p>\n<p>This feature lays the ground work for a full-fledged layout builder in the next phase of Gutenberg development. Reusable templates should make it a breeze to build WordPress sites with pre-defined layouts that users and developers can share. They are much more intuitive to implement than page templates.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Holy wow, imagine this: wp-blueprints.com, where people can group blocks together and share their JSON strings with nice little copy buttons,&#8221; Gutenberg designer Joen Asmussen commented on the PR. &#8220;Categories for top rated, most downloaded, search, etc? This is going to happen because of this magic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Matias Ventura&#8217;s demo video shows the reusable templates in action.

Last year <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com/blog/jsdelivr-reloaded-2017/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">jsDelivr was revamped</a> to allow any file from GitHub and npm to be served by the CDN. WordPress&#8217; mirror on GitHub made it possible for Dinić to create a plugin that works with the CDN.</p>\n<p>commonWP aims to speed up performance by offloading JavaScript and CSS files to jsDelivr, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All files from WordPress core (unless development version of WordPress is in use)</li>\n<li>All files from plugins hosted by WordPress.org Plugins Repository (unless author of specific plugin doesn’t use SVN tags for releasing)</li>\n<li>All files from themes hosted by WordPress.org Themes Repository</li>\n<li>All files from plugins and themes hosted on GitHub that support GitHub Updater</li>\n<li>All files marked as available on npm in any type of theme, plugin, or MU plugin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dinić said he designed commonWP with a emphasis on keeping it lightweight, easy-to-use, and secure. He claims the approach he used in the plugin is safer than any other plugin that employs a CDN for WordPress files:</p>\n<blockquote><p>First, commonWP will only rewrite file to point to one on jsDelivr if that remote file is identical to local one. Second, during comparison, it generates <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">subresource identity hash</a> of remote jsDelivr file and includes that hash in page’s source code so browser won’t load remote file if it doesn’t have exactly the same hash.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dinić recommends the plugin for users who are not already using a CDN, have limited budgets, or live in less developed countries.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Using a CDN is generally recommended, and with this one they might get even more speed because some files might be already cached by their visitors,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Imagine if jquery.js, jquery-migrate.min.js (most common files) are always served from one place. You wouldn&#8217;t need to get them from each WordPress site you visit. You would get them once and they would be in your browser&#8217;s cache, and initial page load would be faster.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dinić referenced a Trac <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44229\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> where using a CDN is proposed for serving assets like jQuery, but no action has been taken on the proposal yet. One benefit he cites for WordPress&#8217; global user base is that a CDN like jsDelivr allows visitors to get files from their own content, country, or even the same city. jsDelivr has a large multi-CDN network with infrastructure built on top of other networks, including StackPath, Cloudflare, Fastly, and Quantil. It also has custom servers in locations like China where other public CDNs have little or no presence.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-21-at-2.39.40-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>commonWP doesn&#8217;t have any settings for users to configure. The plugin fills up its cache in the background after it is activated. Developers can fine tune it for their needs and Dinić has published some <a href=\"https://github.com/dimadin/commonWP#marking-files-that-exist-in-npm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">code examples</a> to GitHub.</p>\n<p>In his release <a href=\"https://milandinic.com/2018/09/18/introducing-commonwp/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a>, Dinić referenced a Serbian site getting a 1-second loading improvement and has done other tests but said he&#8217;s still looking for a good way to present the data. The plugin&#8217;s FAQ outlines which factors influence whether or not commonWP can bring performance improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many of your files are available on jsDelivr and can be rewritten &#8211; the more files on jsDelivr, the more speed; the more files used by the page are rewritten to jsDelivr, the more speed.</li>\n<li>The further your site&#8217;s visitors are from the server your site is hosted on, the more speed you can get.</li>\n<li>The slower your server is, the more speed it can get.</li>\n<li>If your visitors already visited WordPress site(s) with commonWP activated, there is more chance that some of the files you use on your site are already cached by them so they can get more speed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not every site will see drastic improvements for site owners testing performance, but visitors from other parts of the world may be able to load certain files faster. Dinić recommends users test their sites using webpagetest.org and select a higher number of tests to get an average. He also recommends testing with different locations and different connection speeds. Test with the plugin activated and deactivated and when the site has a full cache. In general, the further the location is from the server and the larger number of files sent to jsDelivr, the bigger the performance improvement will be.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 20:19:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: Gutenstats Blog Is Live, Tracking Gutenberg Beta Testing Data\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84153\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenstats-blog-is-live-tracking-gutenberg-beta-testing-data\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1455:\"<p>Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1042901193679241216\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a> out a link to <a href=\"https://gutenstats.blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenstats.blog</a> this evening, a new site dedicated to tracking Gutenberg beta testing data. The site shows there are currently more than 420,000 active installations of Gutenberg, a slightly more precise number than reported on the WordPress.org plugin page (400K+).</p>\n<p>Gutenstats also tracked 213,000 posts written with the new editor and 8,142 posts written yesterday. These numbers were collected from posts made on WordPress.com and Jetpack sites since late August 2018 and a note on the site says the actual number is higher.</p>\n<p>In June, Mullenweg unveiled a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-unveils-gutenberg-roadmap-at-wceu-wordpress-agencies-and-product-developers-sprint-to-prepare\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap for Gutenberg to land in WordPress 5.0</a>. At that time the plugin was active on just 14,000 sites. He proposed 100K+ sites having made 250K+ posts using Gutenberg as a threshold for adequate pre-5.0 testing.</p>\n<p>Gutenstats tracking shows testing has far exceeded the original goal for active installations and should reach the posts written goal in just a few days. Mullenweg said they plan to add some block stats to the tracking page in the future.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 04:21:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: ACF 5.0 Released with Updated UI and Gutenberg Compatibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=84105\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/acf-5-0-released-with-updated-ui-and-gutenberg-compatibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2771:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/acf-5-0-release/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ACF version 5.0</a> landed on WordPress.org this week with Gutenberg compatibility now available for more than one million sites where the plugin is active. The release is a welcome update for developers who were concerned about what would happen in real world usage of Gutenberg on sites with ACF-powered customizations. ACF&#8217;s Gutenberg compatibility is arriving well ahead of WordPress 5.0&#8217;s TBD schedule for merging the new editor, giving developers time to get their clients&#8217; sites ready.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can expect to see lots of Gutenberg related items in our changelogs over the coming months as we edge nearer to WordPress version 5.0,&#8221; the ACF announcement stated. &#8220;You’ll also want to take note that ACF 5 is the only version that will provide Gutenberg support. Previous versions will not be compatible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The version numbers across ACF Pro and the free version on WordPress.org are somewhat confusing. This particular release is significant in that it brings several years of development from the Pro version into the plugin hosted on WordPress.org.

The announcement coincides with International Talk Like a Pirate Day but the pirate branding of the plugin is set to be retired and its users will be given the option to migrate to WPForms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/pirate-forms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pirate Forms</a> was purchased in what WPForms co-founder and CEO Syed Balkhi describes as &#8220;an all-cash deal.&#8221; Although the plugin currently has more than 300,000 users on WordPress.org, its features and capabilities are inferior to the more modern WPForms and its creators lacked the resources to bring it up to speed.</p>\n<p>Pirate Forms had gained popularity in its earlier days by providing a simple forms plugin (without all the builder functions) for sites that required just one contact form.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Where most of the other plugins aim at &#8216;mega functionality&#8217; with tons of customizations, add-ons and whatnots, Pirate Forms has made a bet on simplicity,&#8221; ThemeIsle representative Karol K said in the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://themeisle.com/blog/pirate-forms-is-now-wpforms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">farewell post</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In other words, it just works(ed) right after the installation, with no particular setup required (other than adding your form to a contact page). This was a nice refreshment compared to the usual &#8216;get through tons of onboarding wizard screens before you can use the plugin&#8217; -approach.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pirate Forms could no longer deliver what users expect from a forms plugin in 2018 and ThemeIsle opted to find a buyer in order to free up resources to focus on releasing the <a href=\"https://themeisle.com/blog/hestia-2-0/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hestia 2.0</a> theme.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This acquisition further strengthens WPForms&#8217; position in the WordPress ecosystem,&#8221; Balkhi said. The expectation is that a large number of users will migrate their forms to WPForms as the result of Pirate Forms discontinuing active development.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-move-from-pirate-forms-to-wpforms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A migration path to WPForms</a> is built into the latest version of Pirate Forms and Balkhi describes the process as a seamless transition. Users are also free to select another forms plugin but they will not have the benefit of the migration tool, which also imports the notification email and confirmation settings from users&#8217; existing forms.

The agency worked in partnership with <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com VIP</a> to provide the London-based human rights organization with the tools to create multiple sites that could be uniquely customized for their editorial needs.</p>\n<p>After successfully using Gutenberg to launch a site for an international bank, Big Bite CTO Jason Agnew said his team gained confidence to use the new editor for the Amnesty site. The client approached Bite Bite around the time of WordCamp Europe when Matt Mullenweg unveiled a roadmap for getting a stable Gutenberg release before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On top of this the Amnesty project suited Gutenberg,&#8221; Agnew said. &#8220;Their brief mentioned 14 components which could be used to build out multiple sites. I honestly think it would have been difficult to build something that required this level of flexibility with a field manager like Fieldmanager, CMB2 or ACF. Perhaps it would have been possible with page builders like Visual Composer, but these platforms are still figuring out how they will work with the WordPress 5.0.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Through the use of a combination of prompts, custom blocks, nested blocks, and predefined styles, Big Bite made it possible for even non-technical editorial staff to create and arrange content to build out websites for various outreach locations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been fascinating to give the client full control over the site structure compared to the more traditional development of templates,&#8221; Agnew said. &#8220;We are still in the early stages of launching sites with the new platform, but the client has built up the EU site on their own without much support, which should be going live early October. Now they are in the process building out websites for Mali and Iran, with the goal to launch around 20 sites initially. We&#8217;ve had the editorial team describe the experience as fun &#8211; that&#8217;s from a team who have used WordPress with ACF in the past, which does offer an intuitive UI but still requires a level of training of what fields relate to what pieces of content on the front-end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As many others have reported, one of the most challenging things Big Bite encountered in extending Gutenberg was the project&#8217;s incomplete documentation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had our challenges, and particularly the Gutenberg documentation is not up to standard, which leads to a lot of time being wasted,&#8221; Agnew said. &#8220;But I have to say once our team get over the first block or two it wasn&#8217;t an issue. It&#8217;s important to say that the Gutenberg team Slack have been a great help when we did run into problems. We did discover IE11 support is still a work in progress, for example, copy &amp; paste didn&#8217;t work, meta boxes wouldn&#8217;t render causing saving issues with posts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Agnew said for most issues there isn&#8217;t a lot one can do to resolve them apart from waiting for each update as the plugin improves, but it&#8217;s something agencies need to account for when working with clients. The Big Bite team also found that Gutenberg compatibility is still an issue for many of the plugins that they looked at using for the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Apart from using Yoast we&#8217;ve mainly custom built the theme due to many plugins still requiring UI changes to work well with Gutenberg,&#8221; Agnew said. &#8220;Probably the most significant feature we wrote was language syndication system.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Big Bite plans to open source Amnesty International&#8217;s full theme, which includes all of the custom blocks. Prior to that they are going to remove all the branding to avoid lots of new sites popping looking like the Amnesty brand. The agency is aiming for publishing the code the same day as WordPress 5.0 is released or earlier if the release is delayed beyond January.</p>\n<p>For a closer look at the Amnesty International project, check out Big Bite&#8217;s announcement <a href=\"https://bigbitecreative.com/investing-gutenberg-amnesty-international/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a>.

Since the blocks are JavaScript-only, they would work across both Drupal and WordPress alike, so developers can build for both platforms simultaneously. The Gutenberg Cloud creators are aiming to facilitate a new level of cross-platform sharing that few envisioned when the Gutenberg project began.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg to us is much more than just another module,&#8221; Frontkom CIO Per André Rønsen said during their presentation at Drupal Europe. &#8220;We think of it as a platform for brand new features. We are very excited about the sharing/community aspect and the possibilities here. We want to make it easy to share and reuse custom blocks across pages, across projects, across companies, and even across publishing platforms. Drupal has always been great at sharing backend style of code. Now let&#8217;s make it great at sharing frontend code as well. This is why we&#8217;re working on a block managing system.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gutenberg-cloud.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg Cloud would provide a plugin for WordPress and a module for Drupal (and eventually other applications) that would enable users to browse, filter, and discover blocks within the admin and download the ones they select. Early mockups I previewed show an interface similar to the theme and plugin browsers inside the WordPress admin.</p>\n<p>A cloud-based block service solves a few problems that Gutenberg early adopters are already experiencing when hunting for blocks. WordPress theme and plugin shops have have been releasing their own block collections bundled into a plugin, but it&#8217;s not easy to discover or browse the individual blocks. Having blocks available on Gutenberg Cloud would prevent developers from having to create a new module or plugin for each individual block. It also prevents users from having to download an entire collection of blocks in a plugin when they really only need one or two of them.</p>\n<h3>Gutenberg Cloud Will Launch as a Community Project, Developers Contribute by Publishing Packages to NPM</h3>\n<p>Rønsen said they plan to launch Gutenberg Cloud as a community project. Any developer can contribute blocks by creating an NPM package and tagging it with &#8220;gutenberg-cloud.&#8221; The description on the cloud service outlines their intentions: &#8220;Code once, use everywhere: As Gutenberg blocks are CMS-agnostic, we want to provide an ecosystem all systems can connect to.&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-18-at-3.39.54-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>An example Hero section block published to NPM\n<p>&#8220;We imagine everything from freelancers to big agencies and even community minded non-profits to contribute,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;When people benefit from a better user experience, they tend to want to pay it forward. We have already talked to people in both communities wanting to contribute with code, so that is a great start for the platform.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I asked if his team envisions block creators being able to sell access to their blocks in the future. He said his team is open to finding a payment solution for commercial blocks but only if the community demands it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Personally, I would be skeptical about committing to a community project that had a very commercial edge,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s important that the project stays focused on open source contributions, with a sharing-is-caring attitude. It&#8217;s the only language we know in Drupal. However, there is nothing wrong in providing high quality content and getting paid to do it. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s on our roadmap to facilitate a payment solution for premium blocks – if the community wants it. It&#8217;s not central to the success of the platform, but I imagine it could be a great way to make some money for a skilled designer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rønsen said his team plans to launch Gutenberg Cloud sometime later this year after completing internal testing and an invitation-only closed beta with a different companies. One of the most challenging aspect of the project is creating a system that can handle updates.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By default users will get the latest stable release for the block from the author,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;There will be a way to lock into a specific version and to version control that in Git, however. The plugin update system is a good analogy, but the infrastructure is completely outside of WordPress core. There are also some issues we haven’t solved yet regarding updates; it’s hard to make a system that doesn’t require a high maintenance effort for block developers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Gutenberg Cloud project is contingent upon Gutenberg development continuing on a path towards being a library that is decoupled from WordPress. Last week Rønsen <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/drupal-gutenberg-project-receives-enthusiastic-reception-at-drupal-europe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> the Tavern that his team hopes &#8220;that Gutenberg core devs will catch onto the vision of Gutenberg as the ‘editor for the open web’ — not just for WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg team member Gary Pendergast indirectly acknowledged this in a recent blog <a href=\"https://pento.net/2018/09/16/the-mission-democratise-publishing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> that affirmed the Drupal Gutenberg project and reiterated WordPress&#8217; mission to democratize publishing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the primary philosophies of Gutenberg’s technical architecture is platform agnosticism, and we can see the practical effects of this practice coming to fruition across a variety of projects,&#8221; Pendergast said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From early experiments in running the block editor as a standalone application, to being able to compile it into a native mobile component, and now seeing it running on Drupal, Gutenberg’s technical goals have always included a radical level of platform agnosticism.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If the Drupal community ends up adopting Gutenberg for its core editor, the shared library presents an unprecedented opportunity for deeper collaboration across the two publishing platforms. As an agency that has done client work for publishers on both CMSs, Frontkom saw the potential before many others and took it upon themselves to fork Gutenberg for Drupal. This is the beauty of open source software in action.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress has many advantages that make it so popular, but hoarding those to ourselves doesn’t help the open web, it just creates more silos,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;The open web is the only platform on which publishing can be democratized, so it makes sense for Gutenberg to work anywhere on the open web, not just inside WordPress. Drupal isn’t a competitor here, we’re all working towards the same goal, the different paths we’ve taken have made the open web stronger as a whole.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rønsen said he could see other applications and e-commerce platforms like Magento benefitting from better page-building tools. His company has a special interest in publishers and plans to release a set of open source tools for building news front pages later in 2018. Rønsen said he is hopeful the Drupal Gutenberg project can evolve alongside WordPress as it enters into the site building and customization phase of the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hopeful that the Gutenberg project will stay decoupled from WP one way or another,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;This will leave room for Drupal to innovate on top of it. It could even be the case that the page building tools and customizer integration in WP will play nicely into the current architecture. In any case, I believe the basics of the editor and block concept will continue to be a good fit for Drupal. There is already some consensus out there on how to use Gutenberg for page building. A great example, is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgF5ImDlCTw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Big Bite&#8217;s work with Amnesty</a>. If the continued experience is anything like that, I think we have a perfect match.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 22:38:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Matt: CEOs and the Real World\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48345\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"https://ma.tt/2018/09/ceos-and-the-real-world/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4867:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The downside of Zuckerberg’s exalted status within his company is that it is difficult for him to get genuine, unexpurgated feedback. He has tried, at times, to puncture his own bubble. In 2013, as a New Year’s resolution, he pledged to meet someone new, outside Facebook, every day. In 2017, he travelled to more than thirty states on a “listening tour” that he hoped would better acquaint him with the outside world. David Plouffe, President Obama’s former campaign manager, who is now the head of policy and advocacy at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the family’s philanthropic investment company, attended some events on the tour. He told me, “When a politician goes to one of those, it’s an hour, and they’re talking for fifty of those minutes.

Online, people joked that the photos made him look like an extraterrestrial exploring the human race for the first time. A former Facebook executive who was involved in the tour told a friend, “No one wanted to tell Mark, and no one did tell Mark, that this really looks just dumb.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>There seem to be three communication gaps outlined here in Evan Osnos&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/can-mark-zuckerberg-fix-facebook-before-it-breaks-democracy\">revealing profile of Mark Zuckerberg</a>: one is getting unvarnished feedback from your employees. Speaking as a fellow CEO and founder, it&#8217;s certainly hard to pop that bubble &#8212; see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAxAVusStCg\">&#8220;the bear is sticky with honey.&#8221;</a> There are a few techniques like skip-level 1:1 meetings, anonymous feedback forms, interviewing new hires, and 360 reviews you can do to try to counter this, but there&#8217;s no panacea and this one requires constant work as you scale.</p>\n\n<p>The second gap is getting the unvarnished truth from your users &#8212; much easier, as they&#8217;re quite happy to tell you what&#8217;s what. I&#8217;ve recently started cold-calling (yes, on the phone!) some of our Jetpack customers just to understand what they love and don&#8217;t love about the experience and about how we can help them solve their business challenges. There&#8217;s a casual intimacy to phone conversations that just can&#8217;t be replicated in other user feedback forums. Pair this with good instrumentation throughout your product so you see what people do and not just what they say and you&#8217;re golden.</p>\n\n<p>The third and last communication gap is the connection to the world as most people experience it. If your status, wealth, or celebrity reach a point that they are shutting you out from &#8220;real&#8221; experiences, take some risks and get outside of your comfort zone. As it turns out, <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/the-untold-stories-of-paul-mccartney\">this new GQ profile of Paul McCartney offered a tip on that: </a></p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>McCartney tells me a further such story of a time he took the Hampton Jitney, the slightly upmarket bus service that runs from the Hamptons into Manhattan, because he was deep into Charles Dickens&#8217;s Nicholas Nickleby and he wanted to finish it, and how he then took a local bus uptown, and when a woman blurted from across the bus, &#8220;Hey! Are you Paul McCartney?&#8221; he invited her to sit next to him and chatted all the way uptown. &#8220;It&#8217;s a way of not worrying about your fame,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a way of not turning into the reclusive rock star. I often say to Nancy: I get in their faces before they get a chance to get in mine.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Makes me wonder if <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/jack-dorsey-bus-bubble/\">Jack Dorsey still rides the bus to work every day</a>. I think this is what Zuckerberg was attempting with his 30-state tour, and hopefully it was helpful even if the optics didn&#8217;t appeal to everyone — the daily habit of his 2013 resolution to meet someone new every day feels more powerful than the touristic 30-state one. But for an entity as large as Facebook maybe it&#8217;s moot, as Casey Newton pointed out <a href=\"https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton/issues/the-trouble-with-mark-zuckerberg-profiles-133299\">in his newsletter last week</a> it can be quite hard to pin the answers to Facebook&#8217;s real problems, and our democracy&#8217;s real challenges <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2018/09/responsibility-of-technology/\">in the face of targeted online propaganda</a>, to just one person.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 21:35:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: Hybrid Core 5.0 Offers a More Modern, Modular Approach to WordPress Theme Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83987\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wptavern.com/hybrid-core-5-0-offers-a-more-modern-modular-approach-to-wordpress-development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3877:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/coffee-computer.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/JFPYO9HEZR\">Shopify</a>\n<p><a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/weblog/hybrid-core-version-5-0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Version 5.0</a> of Hybrid Core, one of the longest-running WordPress theme frameworks, is now available. Justin Tadlock celebrated 10 years with his Theme Hybrid community last month and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/mythic-a-wordpress-starter-theme-by-justin-tadlock-now-in-open-beta\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">released his new Mythic starter theme into beta</a>. Mythic was built on top of Hybrid Core and developed in tandem with version 5.0.</p>\n<p>The framework has been rewritten almost entirely from scratch to be a leaner, more modern starting place for theme development. Tadlock describes it as &#8220;a fundamentally different framework, rewritten from the ground up, that supports more modern PHP practices.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I started 5.0 with a goal of bringing the framework up to date with more modern PHP practices and code,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The first iteration of the framework was built in 2008, so it was time to get us ready for the next era of theme building.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In nearly a decade of supporting the framework, Tadlock found that users didn&#8217;t always know how to get started building something from scratch. Many copied one of his existing themes and would add and remove things from it based on their own needs.</p>\n<p>Version 5.0 doesn&#8217;t necessarily make it easier to build on top of Hybrid Core with its new, more complicated method of bootstrapping, new <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/weblog/working-with-the-view-class\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">view system for templating</a>, and requirement for using <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Composer</a>. This is why Tadlock is officially recommending <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/themes/mythic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mythic</a> as the path for building a theme with Hybrid Core in the future. Most of the documentation and tutorials he plans to create in the future will be centered around the Mythic starter theme, which is nearing a 1.0 release.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We just closed all tickets on the 1.0.0 milestone for the Mythic starter theme! It feels pretty good.</p>\n<p>Barring any OMGBBQ issues between now and tomorrow, you should see an announcement post from me.<a href=\"https://t.co/J4CGLKa1y5\">https://t.co/J4CGLKa1y5</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Justin Tadlock (@justintadlock) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justintadlock/status/1041808697813598208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 17, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>For many theme developers, Mythic&#8217;s use of the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) CSS class-naming system is their first introduction to a system of non-hierarchal, component-based CSS. Because BEM doesn&#8217;t rely on nested selectors, it&#8217;s easier for users to overwrite CSS that they want to change. Tadlock explains the benefit for child themes in a recent post about <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/weblog/why-mythic-uses-bem\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">why Mythic uses BEM</a>.</p>\n<p>A handful of the Hybrid add-ons are now available as Composer packages, including one for breadcrumbs, customizer controls and settings, Google fonts, and a featured image script. Tadlock plans to split more parts of the framework off into packages in the future for an increasingly modular core.</p>\n<p>Hybrid Core 5.0 requires PHP 5.6+ (with 7.0+ recommended) and WordPress 4.9.6+. Tadlock will support Hybrid Core&#8217;s 4.x series for at least another year to give theme authors time to adapt.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 04:07:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Yoast SEO 8.2 Adds How-To and FAQ Gutenberg Blocks with Structured Data\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83822\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/yoast-seo-8-2-adds-how-to-and-faq-gutenberg-blocks-with-structured-data\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2422:\"<p><a href=\"https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-8-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yoast SEO 8.2</a> was released last week with the plugin&#8217;s first tools designed specifically for Gutenberg. It includes two new How-To and FAQ structured data content blocks for early adopters of the new editor.</p>\n<p>Structured data is content that can be marked up with a shared vocabulary, such as the one provided by <a href=\"http://Schema.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Schema.org</a>. Content like products, books, reviews, podcasts, events, and recipes lend themselves well to this specific type of organization. Structured data helps search engines index the site more effectively and communicate results in more compelling ways, such as rich snippets, rich cards, or voice search.</p>\n<p>Structured data is not easy for most WordPress users to implement without the help of a plugin. Now that more content is being created in Gutenberg, users who want their content to display as enhanced search results will need to seek out plugins that make that an automatic part of the content creation process.</p>\n<p>The plugin outlines all the necessary data the users needs to add in order for the How-To and FAQ content blocks to appear as valid pieces of structured data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/faq-structured-data-yoast-seo.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Alongside this release, Yoast&#8217;s <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/local-seo/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Local SEO</a> and the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/local-seo-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce SEO</a> plugins have also added two new structured data Gutenberg blocks: an address block and a Google Maps block.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/local_seo_content_blocks.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: <a href=\"https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-8-2/\">Yoast.com</a>\n<p>In the future the Yoast team plans to create many more structured data blocks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ll work first on blocks which we can dogfood on Yoast.com, like Job posting and Event,&#8221; Yoast CTO Omar Reiss <a href=\"https://yoast.com/content-blocks-future-benefit-seo/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;After that, we’ll just go for the popular ones, like Recipe.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:43:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Gary: The Mission: Democratise Publishing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://pento.net/?p=1909\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://pento.net/2018/09/16/the-mission-democratise-publishing/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5406:\"<p>It&#8217;s exciting to see the <a href=\"https://drupalgutenberg.org/\">Drupal Gutenberg</a> project getting under way, it makes me proud of the work we&#8217;ve done ensuring the flexibility of the underlying Gutenberg architecture. One of the primary philosophies of Gutenberg&#8217;s technical architecture is platform agnosticism, and we can see the practical effects of this practice coming to fruition across a variety of projects.</p>\n\n<p>Yoast are <a href=\"https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-8-2/\">creating new features for the block editor</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-8-0-introducing-the-yoast-seo-gutenberg-sidebar-a-revamped-meta-box/\">porting existing features</a>, which they&#8217;re able to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronjorbin/status/1040988210682318848\">reuse in the classic editor</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of WordPress Core, the Automattic teams who work on <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso\">Calypso</a> have been <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/search?q=gutenberg\">busy</a> adding Gutenberg support, in order to make the block editor interface available on WordPress.com. Gutenberg and Calypso are large JavaScript applications, built with strong opinions on design direction and technical architecture, and having <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/27034\">significant component overlap</a>. That these two projects can function together at all is something of an obscure engineering feat that&#8217;s both difficult and overwhelming to appreciate.</p>\n\n<p>If we reached the limit of Gutenberg&#8217;s platform agnosticism here, it would still be a successful project.</p>\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s not where the ultimate goals of the Gutenberg project stand. From <a href=\"https://github.com/youknowriad/standalone-gutenberg\">early experiments</a> in running the block editor as a <a href=\"https://gutenberg-standalone.surge.sh/\">standalone application</a>, to being able to compile it into a <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/gutenberg-mobile\">native mobile component</a>, and now seeing it <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gutenberg\">running on Drupal</a>, Gutenberg&#8217;s technical goals have always included a radical level of platform agnosticism.</p>\n\n<h2>Better Together</h2>\n\n<p>Inside the WordPress world, significant effort and focus has been on ensuring backwards compatibility with existing WordPress sites, plugins, and practices. Given that WordPress is such a hugely popular platform, it&#8217;s exceedingly important to ensure this is done right. With Gutenberg expanding outside of the WordPress world, however, we&#8217;re seeing different focuses and priorities arise.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gutenbergcloud.org/\">Gutenberg Cloud</a> service is a fascinating extension being built as part of the Drupal Gutenberg project, for example. It provides a method for new blocks to be shared and discovered, the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@frontkom/g-hero-section\">sample hero block</a> sets a clear tone of providing practical components that can be rapidly put together into a full site. While we&#8217;ve certainly seen similar services appear for the various site builder plugins, this is the first one (that I&#8217;m aware of, at least) build specifically for Gutenberg.</p>\n\n<p>By making the Gutenberg experience available for everyone, regardless of their technical proficiency, experience, or even <em>preferred platform</em>, we pave the way for a better future for all.</p>\n\n<h2>Democratising Publishing</h2>\n\n<p>You might be able to guess where this is going. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n<p>WordPress&#8217; mission is to &#8220;democratise publishing&#8221;. It isn&#8217;t to &#8220;be the most popular CMS&#8221;, or to &#8220;run on old versions of PHP&#8221;, though it&#8217;s easy to think that might be the case on the surface. That these statements are true is simply a side effect of the broader principle: All people, regardless of who they are or where they come from, should be able to publish their content as part of a free and open web.</p>\n\n<p>The WordPress mission is not to &#8220;democratise publishing with WordPress&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>WordPress has many advantages that make it so popular, but hoarding those to ourselves doesn&#8217;t help the open web, it just creates more silos. The open web is the only platform on which publishing can be democratised, so it makes sense for Gutenberg to work anywhere on the open web, not just inside WordPress. Drupal isn&#8217;t a competitor here, we&#8217;re all working towards the same goal, the different paths we&#8217;ve taken have made the open web stronger as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Much as the block editor has been the first practical implementation of the Gutenberg architecture, WordPress is simply the first practical integration of the block editor into a CMS. The Gutenberg project will expand into site customisation and theming next, and while there&#8217;s no requirement that Drupal make use of these, I&#8217;d be very interested to see what they came up with if they did. Bringing together our many years of experience in tackling these complex problems can only make the end result better.</p>\n\n<p>I know I&#8217;m looking forward to all of us working together for the betterment of the open web.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 16 Sep 2018 04:48:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Gary\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 3.8 Released, Adds Full Screen Mode\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83861\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-3-8-released-adds-full-screen-mode\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2254:\"<p>Gutenberg 3.8 is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">available for download</a>.

They also created the <a href=\"https://drupalgutenberg.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal Gutenberg</a> project, which aims to bring this new publishing experience to Drupal core.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Building landing pages in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Drupal?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Drupal</a> has never been easier.

They concluded the presentation by hailing Gutenberg as an exciting new tool that will bring companies new business, make happier clients, and inspire more code reuse and sharing among developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The reception has been amazing,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;A lot of different speakers have referred to Gutenberg both before and after the session. Bigger organizations and companies have expressed interest in implementation and contributing.

However, Rønsen said he received feedback from some who are concerned about how it stores data. He said the general consensus was that &#8220;the UI is awesome,&#8221; but that the Drupal Gutenberg project would need to make sure data is stored in way that is as structured and portable as possible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some developers are skeptical about storing too much data unstructured like Gutenberg does,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;This also means we might integrate Gutenberg closer to some key Drupal modules used for structured page building today. Gutenberg can serve as a UI for embedding existing structured content, and that is something we are looking into.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rønsen said the next steps are centered around getting a stable release that will handle the core Gutenberg blocks and the core D8 blocks in a way that is future proof. In order to do this, they are waiting for the project to be merged into WordPress core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will delay a stable release until Gutenberg is in WP core,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;Things are moving very fast still with Gutenberg – and that’s a good thing. As soon as we have a stable release, we will introduce tools we have built in top of Gutenberg for publishers. These will be available to WordPress, too.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Gutenberg as the “editor for the open web” — not just for WordPress</h3>\n<p>One of the most exciting aspects of the Frontkom team&#8217;s presentation was the idea of sharing a project across publishing platforms.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is key for us that Gutenberg stays decoupled from both CMSs as a library, and our hope is that Gutenberg core devs will catch onto the vision of Gutenberg as the &#8216;editor for the open web&#8217; — not just for WordPress,&#8221; Rønsen said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Drupal core developers are however planning a React-based revamp of the Drupal admin UI, too. It will take at least two years to release it, and even then, I’m of the opinion that the content edit UI and page building features should be done last, and rather leave room for third party solutions like Gutenberg. This is an open question, but at least the key decisions makers for the new UI will consider how Gutenberg works and learn from it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Drupal decision makers are also taking interest in Gutenberg and seem open to considering it as viable option for improving the CMS&#8217;s editing experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When the Drupal project owner was asked directly in a Q&amp;A what he thought about solutions like Gutenberg coming into Drupal, he said he liked it, and that it’s a good thing for Drupal,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;Dries is very open minded and not afraid of the concept of &#8216;Proudly built elsewhere.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rønsen and Fernandes have <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rm1tiXR9sAVqasT8L8SZCg1LBVuTTuG3otNj_3Sj2r8/edit#slide=id.g321e3b1fbe_0_57\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published the slides</a> for those who want to view them, although most of the session was devoted to the live demo.

The minor release will be led by Anthony Burchell and Alain Schlesser. It is targeted for November 5 with the first beta arriving near the end of October.</p>\n<p>The leads identified four key focus areas for the upcoming release: accessibility, internationalization, the Site Health Project, and Gutenberg preparation. The internationalization focus is aimed at improving translations and RTL support, as well as ensuring that date/time values work. The roadmap doesn&#8217;t identify any specific accessibility items but Burchell said the leads see lots of ways they can &#8220;drastically improve the experience for a lot of people with minimal effort.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contributors to the Site Health Project, previously known by the &#8220;Servehappy&#8221; code name, will be working on resolving issues that will allow users to stay on WordPress 4.9.9 while they prepare for 5.0 and still have access to the important information about how to update their PHP versions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It will be crucial to get the Servehappy components included: WSOD protection, update dashboard notice, plugin version requirements,&#8221; Burchell said. &#8220;The reason for this focus is because, when 5.0 ships, users who decide not to upgrade will be on 4.9.9 for a potentially extended time period. If we don’t have these Servehappy components included in 4.9.9, getting rid of old PHP versions will only happen after 5.0.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another major part of WordPress 4.9.9 will be landing items that lay the groundwork for anything necessary for Gutenberg&#8217;s merge into 5.0. Two items identified include <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44758\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">user locale support in REST API endpoints</a> and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44862\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">endpoints to lock/unlock and release posts</a>.</p>\n<p>With an unusually quick turnaround, WordPress 5.0 could arrive before the end of 2018. Development will kick off in mid-November, one week ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 9/13/2018 &#8211; 8:13PM:</strong> The wording on the roadmap document has been updated to more accurately reflect the intentions of contributors regarding the work outlined for the Site Health Project. The roadmap now reads:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;We will investigate the work remaining for the Servehappy project and determine how to get it in people’s hands as soon as possible. WSOD protection, update dashboard notice, plugin version requirements are the hot items pending.&#8221;</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 17:58:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"HeroPress: Diversity of Thought\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=2623\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://heropress.com/diversity-of-thought/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=diversity-of-thought\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3237:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/092017-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I became completely inspired by the mission of WordPress.

I can read about it, but I&#8217;ll never actually have the experiences.</p>\n<p>The story really needs to come from someone with experience.

A <a href=\"http://ideas.woocommerce.com/forums/133476-woocommerce/suggestions/6172593-android-equivalent-of-woocommerce-ios-app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">suggestion for an Android app</a> received 533 upvotes on the WooCommerce ideas board.

A cursory glance at the reviews for these apps shows that most of them are slow, buggy, and not very well supported. However, they have temporarily fulfilled a need in the absence of an official app from WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>Considering the options currently available, an official WooCommerce app will be a welcome addition to the tools available for store owners.

As an open source platform, it&#8217;s become a dominant CMS used by 30% of the web to publish content — on websites large and small.</p>\n<p>WordPress has grown up in an era of evolving challenges: ushering in web standards, adapting for publishing and viewing on all device sizes; building for accessibility by all; establishing its place in the era of expansive and centralized social media platforms; and more.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re faced with a new generation of technologies coming down the pipe, ready to disrupt the current ecosystem. These technologies include blockchain, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, the internet of things, and more I&#8217;m sure. It’s the first of these that is the focus of this post and the following conversation.</p>\n<p>I was approached by David Lockie of <a href=\"https://pragmatic.agency/\">Pragmatic</a> to discuss how WordPress and blockchain technology may fit together, and how they may not. David and I have both been interested in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space over the past couple of years, and have over time encountered a lot of projects that aim to disrupt or enhance various elements of the web: from DNS to CMS.</p>\n<p>David gathered a group of people for an initial online, open, honest conversation about how WordPress could be impacted, disrupted or take advantage of distributed ledger and blockchain technologies.</p>\n<p>Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blockchain platforms impacting people’s choice to use WordPress e.g. <a href=\"https://steemit.com/\">Steemit</a></li>\n<li>Blockchain projects impacting people already using WordPress e.g. <a href=\"https://www.basicattentiontoken.org/\">Basic Attention Token</a> or <a href=\"https://www.po.et/\">Po.et</a>, <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/2018/07/11/client-spotlight-civil/\">Civil</a></li>\n<li>Cryptocurrencies’ impact on eCommerce and the wider ecosystem, e.g. the Coinbase Commerce merchant gateway</li>\n<li>What we can learn from blockchain projects’ governance systems and lessons learned</li>\n<li>Ideas for improving security, integrations, etc</li>\n<li>Various identity-based projects</li>\n<li>New environments which may be used to run WordPress, such as decentralized web technologies e.g. <a href=\"https://substratum.net/\">Substratum </a> or <a href=\"https://www.maidsafe.net/\">MaidSafe</a>.</li>\n<li>Impact on the talent pool for WordPress professionals</li>\n<li>General <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/dcent/wordpress-and-blockchain-threats-and-opportunities\">threats and opportunities</a></li>\n<li>Discussion of anything new, interesting and relevant in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space</li>\n<li>All of the above as it relates to open source and the web generally, outside of WordPress</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our aim for the initial conversation, as well as future conversations, <strong>is not</strong> to advocate specifically for any existing project or to necessarily endorse blockchain as appropriate for WordPress to somehow integrate in any way. It&#8217;s to explore what&#8217;s out there now, how it could impact WordPress today and in the future, and down the road perhaps how WordPress may take advantage of potential opportunities. We are approaching this like a discovery phase — not to get overly excited, but to be informed. And we welcome participants in this conversation.</p>\n<p>This first conversation included the following participants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>David Lockie, <a href=\"https://pragmatic.agency/\">Pragmatic</a></li>\n<li>Brian Krogsgard, Post Status</li>\n<li>Bradford Campeau-Laurion, <a href=\"https://alley.co/\">Alley Interactive</a></li>\n<li>Zac Gordon, <a href=\"https://zacgordon.com/\">Deeply</a></li>\n<li>Christie Chirinos, <a href=\"https://calderalabs.org/\">Caldera Labs</a></li>\n<li>Josh Pollock, <a href=\"https://calderalabs.org/\">Caldera Labs</a></li>\n<li>Brad Williams, <a href=\"https://webdevstudios.com/\">WebDevStudios</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I attempted to reiterate it in the call, but I believe it&#8217;s important to address this topic with a skeptic&#8217;s hat on. By no means do any of us think that it&#8217;s a great idea to just go head first in trying to integrate blockchain technology to WordPress. The jury is still very much out in terms of where, how, and even if blockchain brings significant advantages to web applications.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you are interested in future discussions, we welcome you! There is currently a channel (#blockchain) in Post Status Slack where people can discuss, and we&#8217;ll also announce future video-conference discussions. We may make a more independent place to discuss, blog, etc, in the future depending on how these early conversations go.</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t know exactly where this conversation will go. It may fizzle out, or it could evolve into a much broader community effort. The first thing to do, if you are interested to continue this conversation, is just follow along with future conversations, which will be posted here.

The entire team has been texting back and forth every several hours on various decisions over many days.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We ended up having to set thresholds in advance for canceling.  Then on Monday morning, we started to get inquiries and cancellations of attendees, vendors and speakers so we had to make a call.&#8221; </p>\n\n<p>Although a lot hours were spent by volunteers to organize the event, speaker, attendee, and sponsor safety took priority. <br /></p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The organizing team is totally bummed about canceling the event considering the amount of effort we put into organizing it,&#8221; La Fond said. &#8220;However, we’re more concerned about the safety and security of our family and friends.

The plugin, created by the team at <a href=\"https://updraftplus.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UpdraftPlus</a>, is active on more than 900,000 sites, more than any other free slider plugin, and averages a 4.7-star review.

Joe Miles, director of Business Strategy at UpdraftPlus, said the team sees the Gutenberg editor as a major improvement especially for those who are new to WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think Gutenberg makes it much easier for novices to web design to make changes and insert sliders,&#8221; Miles said. &#8220;I know people who&#8217;d be comfortable using a Gutenberg block but not comfortable using a shortcode as it looks scary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Miles said the company is currently working on adding the ability for users to create and edit sliders within Gutenberg and hope to include it in the plugin before WordPress 5.0 lands. The UpdraftPlus team includes 13 developers who are devoted to the company&#8217;s WP-Optimize and MetaSlider products. Miles said adapting to Gutenberg was fairly simple relative to some of the other projects the team is working on.</p>\n<p>UpdraftPlus plans to continue to maintain and improve the shortcode-based slider insertion method, as demonstrated in the changelog. Users who opt to stick with the Classic Editor will still be able to keep their same workflow. Meanwhile, the product&#8217;s development team will be working on integrating all of the pro version&#8217;s front-end features with Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>In addition to Gutenberg support, the team is also going to be <a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/metasliders-bringing-out-new-slider-themes-and-theyre-completely-free/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">adding the concept of themes to sliders</a> so users can build a slider and change its theme in a couple of clicks. They plan to release free and commercial themes and all will be built to be compatible with Gutenberg.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/smart-slider-3/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Slider 3</a>, MetaSlider&#8217;s next closest competitor with 300,000 installs, is <a href=\"https://smartslider3.com/blog/gutenberg-and-smart-slider-3-how-to-add-sliders-to-wordpress/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">also compatible with Gutenberg</a> with a similar workflow for inserting sliders. Both slider plugins are not yet capable of providing the slider creation and editing process inside the Gutenberg interface but the capabilities should evolve as WordPress gets closer to the 5.0 release.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I personally love the idea of Gutenberg since Matt Mullenweg announced it at WordCamp EU 2017,&#8221; Miles said. &#8220;I understand why experienced developers don&#8217;t want the change, but too many people are going for inferior website solutions like WIX because they&#8217;re used to WYSIWYG. So adapting MetaSlider was a no-brainer.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 20:59:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: Marcel Bootsman is Walking 700km to WordCamp Europe to Raise Funds for DonateWC\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83797\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wptavern.com/marcel-bootsman-is-walking-700km-to-wordcamp-europe-to-raise-funds-for-donatewc\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3272:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-11-at-3.37.12-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In May 2019, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbootsman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Marcel Bootsman</a> will be lacing up a pair of hiking boots and walking 700km (435 miles) from his home in Rotterdam to WordCamp Europe in Berlin. Bootsman, a WordPress consultant and WordCamp organizer, is walking to raise funds and awareness for the <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DonateWC</a> organization.</p>\n<p>The DonateWC initiative provides a global fund for helping people in need of financial assistance to attend a big WordCamp. Donations go towards individually-tailored sponsorships that help selected attendees purchase a WordCamp ticket, door-to-door transportation, food and drink, and internet access.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Imagine for a moment that you are not backed by a company that will pay for you to go to a community event,&#8221; DonateWC founder Ines van Essen said. &#8220;You work hard at being a valuable community member but are never able to actually meet the others in your team. This means you are less likely to get a job, less likely to get recognized as a worthwhile member, you’re unlikely to be at the front-end of changes that impact your work significantly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DonateWC aims to keep the larger WordCamps from being unintentionally exclusive of those with lesser financial means. Bootsman said he believes in the organization because it is community-driven and enables the greater WordPress community to do something for their fellow community members.</p>\n<p>So far, Bootsman&#8217;s walking journey has raised €116.57. He set up a <a href=\"https://walktowc.eu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">walktowc.eu</a> website to track his progress and the <a href=\"https://walktowc.eu/donate/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">donation page</a> displays a live update of donated funds. Contributors have the option to designate their donations for DonateWC or for Bootsman&#8217;s personal needs on the trek. He plans to deliver all of the funds raised for the organization when he arrives in Berlin. In the coming weeks he will also open up sponsor packages to better motivate companies to donate.</p>\n<p>Bootsman does not plan to work during his trek. He will be on the road for approximately 30 days and plans to walk 30km per day. He is traveling light with just a backpack and is looking for places where he can sleep along the way. Bootsman will update the <a href=\"https://walktowc.eu/route/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Route page</a> on his website with the places where people volunteer a bed for him to spend the night.</p>\n<p>If you want to keep track of his progress, follow the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/walktowceu?src=hash\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#walktwceu</a> on Twitter. Bootsman has published his first vlog about his training sessions (see video below) where you can hear in his own words why his making the long journey on foot. When I asked him if he&#8217;ll be walking home after WordCamp Europe, he said, &#8220;You&#8217;re kidding, right?&#8221;</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 22:25:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"Matt: WP Dev on Chromebook\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48342\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://ma.tt/2018/09/wp-dev-on-chromebook/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:256:\"<p>Dan Walmsley has an interesting <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/2018/09/11/developing-wordpress-jetpack-and-calypso-on-chromeos/\">walkthrough on getting set up for WordPress and Calypso development on the new Linux mode on a Chromebook</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 18:29:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WPTavern: Hemingway Theme Adds Gutenberg Support\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83790\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/hemingway-theme-adds-gutenberg-support\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4178:\"<p>Anders Norén has <a href=\"http://www.andersnoren.se/hemingway-meet-gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">added Gutenberg support</a> to his popular <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/hemingway/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hemingway</a> theme in the latest update, version 1.66. The theme has a simple, timeless design that appeals to both bloggers and business owners alike. It is active on more than 30,000 websites and some of those site administrators are using Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>What does Gutenberg support look like for Hemingway? Norén styled the editor to match the front-end design, with the same colors and fonts. He also added support for specific Gutenberg blocks, such as cover images, full-width elements, and pull quotes.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hemingway-gutenberg-e1536683158337.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: Anders Norén\n<p>Norén said he knew since Gutenberg was announced that he would need to add support to all 17 of his themes in a substantial update at some point but had put it off because developing for the new editor felt &#8220;like aiming for a moving target.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don’t think it was any single thing that made me realize that I needed to get going with Gutenberg, but rather that the Gutenberg volume knob in the community has been turned up at a steady pace,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;After the &#8216;Try Gutenberg&#8217; prompt in 4.9.8, I also started to receive a lot more support requests regarding Gutenberg. When regular WordPress users – not developers – started to ask when they can expect Gutenberg support in my themes, I knew that I couldn’t push it ahead of me much further.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hemingway is the first of his themes to support the new editor and Norén is aiming to have his entire collection Gutenberg-ready by the time WordPress 5.0 is released. (This does not include the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/theme/hemingway-rewritten\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hemingway Rewritten</a> version, which was created by Automattic and is available on WordPress.com.)</p>\n<p>Norén sees the new editor as a significant improvement over the current editor and said he thinks it is the right way forward for WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s always easy to speculate about the road not travelled, but the Visual Editor needs replacement, and Gutenberg will be a good replacement for it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It’s better at everything the old editor can do (except editing raw HTML, perhaps), and it also brings with it new possibilities for WordPress developers and users. There are a lot of issues in Gutenberg still to be worked out, but when they are, I think Gutenberg will be a big step forward for the WordPress community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Norén said his chief concern is not about the editor itself but about how WordPress will handle the transition period for users, especially for those who would benefit from continuing on with the Classic Editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope that the upgrade notice for 5.0 will be accompanied by clear messaging around the changes included in 5.0, along with the option to install the Classic Editor in Gutenberg&#8217;s stead,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;Similar to the &#8216;Try Gutenberg&#8217; prompt, but presented more clearly as an either-or option before the user actually updates to 5.0. It was encouraging to see Matt Mullenweg say that the Classic Editor will be maintained for many years to come.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Norén&#8217;s 17 free WordPress.org-hosted themes have an estimated 100,000 active installs. Those using his products can be confident that the author behind the themes has Gutenberg-support among his immediate priorities for updates. Users who opt to move forward using the Classic Editor should not notice a difference in how the themes work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope that Gutenberg is received with excitement and widespread support when 5.0 is finally released,&#8221; Noren said. &#8220;I also hope that the WordPress team does whatever it can to make sure that end-users don’t feel ambushed by the new editing experience.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 18:04:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Meetup Group Organizers Can Now Earn A WordPress.org User Profile Badge\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83806\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/meetup-group-organizers-can-now-earn-a-wordpress-org-user-profile-badge\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2241:\"<p>The WordPress Community team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/09/10/new-tool-for-community-deputies-meetup-tracker/\">has unveiled</a> a new tool called Meetup Tracker.

The following morning we returned knowing that our presentations needed to be completed by lunch time. It was a test of team work, collaboration, compromise, clear communication and good business acumen. Finally we were all ready to pitch to our investors.

My decision to be an active participant meant that from the start I had made myself vulnerable to success or failure.

Logically success or failure is based on accurately achieving a goal, an aim or a purpose. In competitive scenarios the successor is the one who comes closest to achieving a goal, aim or purpose. With this in mind the first thing we need to do to be successful is clearly understand the goal, aim or purpose.

I imagined how my team would have responded if we had been successful. We would have glowed with pride and smiled with accomplishment.

We would have been open to integrating with other participants, taking praise and talking about how and what we had done to achieve our success.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">And how did we act in failure? We were outwardly sympathetic towards our team members. We were introvert, retrospective, critical and analytical. We wanted to to expose the weeds and acknowledge the areas of weakness.

Some say that failure is the key to success and perhaps that is true but only in so far as you choose to learn from your failure. If failure has you feeling so hurt and disheartened that you decide not to expose yourself and give up then it won\'t help you succeed. With this in mind we must choose our goal, aim or purpose carefully. If we are passionate about achieving our goal, aim or purpose because we know that it will bring us lasting fulfilment, satisfaction and happiness then we are more likely to learn from our failures allowing them to further motivate us to try again.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The best thing we can do to alleviate the suffering we create around failure is to respond to it the same as success.

If we can fail with a smile on our face in the knowledge that we will learn from our mistakes, then we can create a new culture where individuals are inspired to try without fear and stigma of failure.

Northern India earlier this year. Everyone I met was raving about his Satsangs, but unfortunately he left before I had a chance to hear him speak.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to England I went to a gig in north London to see <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/samgarrettmusic\">Sam Garrett</a> who turned out to be a Mooji devotee, his music is beautiful and he mentioned Mooji numerous times during the performance. So the seed had been sown and I knew I needed to find out more about this <em>Mooji</em>.  I discovered his Ashram was in Portugal and there was an upcoming 10 day silent retreat. The retreat was in such high demand that places were offered via lottery.  I entered and to my surprise I got a place.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-127\" src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/montesahaja1-300x200.jpg\" sizes=\"85vw\" alt=\"montesahaja1\" />\r\n\r\nMoojis\' ashram is <a href=\"http://mooji.org/monte-sahaja/\">Monte Sahaja</a> in southern Portugal and every grain of sand is imbibed with love. He has created heaven on earth where those inclined can spend time to discover their true nature. The format of the retreat is to attend 2 Satsangs a day, which last around 3 hours.  It is  during this Satsangs that Mooji transmits to you the Truth.

I started Aya because I wanted to offer you the option to choose a purely plantbased alternative to cow\'s butter and other vegetable based oil spreads which is just as tasty and just as versatile - now you can choose a kinder option whenever you like.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"inline-quote\">\r\n<p class=\"blockquote\">The more we grow and make an impact the more we will be able to make demands that align with our highest values but we will need your loyalty to get there.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Our values and ethics</h2>\r\nAya is far more than plantbased; our values and ethics extend to everything we do.  As a start:\r\n<ul class=\"ayaList\">\r\n<li>We prioritise <span class=\"emphasis\">sustainability</span> which means that we will always consider the impact of our activities on the the environment:</li>\r\n<li>We prioritise <span class=\"emphasis\">transparency</span> which means we believe that you have a right to know exactly what you are buying and how our business operates:</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We will always provide you with information about what our products contain, how they are made and where the ingredients are sourced.</li>\r\n<li>We will always warn you of any health risks associated with our products.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>We prioritise <span class=\"emphasis\">ethical trade</span> and adhere to the Ethical Trade Initiative Basic Code, United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation Core Conventions.</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We will always provide a fair livelihood for all our employees.  We believe that an individual\'s work should offer in return a sustainable and fair livelihood as well as job satisfaction.  We understand that the role of work is only one aspect of an individual\'s life and that happiness can only be achieved in a holistic and balanced way of living.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"justify\">As a start-up we realise the importance of creating a profitable business that aligns with our core values.  We must be profitable so that we can pay our employees, provide a comfortable and conducive working environment and pay our investors a fair return on their investment.  Sometimes we may have to make a small compromise on our values but we will always do so with openness and inform you of our decision.  We will then consistently reassess our decisions in a timely manner.</p> \r\n\r\n<h3>This is what we have implemented so far:</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ayaList\">\r\n<li>We only use <span class=\"emphasis\">non-GMO, organic ingredients</span> because we believe that food should be natural and we do not advocate any chemicals used in the growing, cultivation or processing of our ingredients</li>\r\n<li>We choose <span class=\"emphasis\">no palm-oil</span> because of the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TQQXstNh45g\">catastrophic effects that palm-oil cultivation has had on our rain forests and their inhabitants</a></li>\r\n<li>We will never use plastic, we choose to <span class=\"emphasis\">package our plantbutters in compostable greaseproof paper</span> because this has the lowest environmental impact.  We encourage butter dishes as a way of preserving your butter in the fridge.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>And this is what we intend to implement as soon as we possibly can:</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ayaList\">\r\n<li>We will be a <a href=\"https://bcorporation.net/\">Certified B Corporation</a>.  Certified B Corporations meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability. B Corporations are people using business as a force of good.</li>\r\n<li>We will be both <a href=\"https://www.soilassociation.org/\">Soil Association Organic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vegansociety.com/\">The Vegan Society</a> accredited.</li>\r\n<li>We will use <a href=\"https://www.fairtrade.org.uk/\">Fairtrade Foundation</a> ingredients whenever we can.  Fairtrade is about better prices, decent working conditions, local sustainability and fair terms of trade for farmers and workers in the developing world.

Although I knew they were far better for the environment I avoided them.  The reasons were the same as why I had stopped using tampons - I  don\'t like the idea of anything man-made going up my vagina (which is a bit contradictory since I have had 100\'s of condoms up there), I don\'t like the idea of a blood soaked tampon just sitting there and because of the risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) which can occur when a tampon is left in too long.  \r\n\r\nAfter more than 24 months of throwing aways small bags of pads every month I finally decided that I would to give them a go and ordered a £4.50 iCare from ebay.  \r\n\r\nTo my surprise they work really well, no leaks not even when I was bouldering.  Plus, I didn\'t have to endure a week of big panties (for safety) and sitting in blood soaked pads for hours (so gross)!  Plus there\'s no smells!  Considering all the benefits of a menstrual cup including the one closest to my heart, reducing environmental waste, why aren\'t pad and tampon companies switching to menstrual cups and why aren\'t these sold in the grocery stores?\r\n\r\nSo how was the iCare menstrual cup?  The experience of inserting a silicon cup up your v-jay-jay certainly does take some getting used too.  Like anyone who has inserted anything up their vagina there is a constant awareness that this must also come out.  The iCare cup has a short pulling bit which sits just inside your vagina so it\'s discreet and doesn\'t get in the way.  This does make it bit scary in the beginning, the thought that the cup may somehow get too high and I wouldn\'t be able to find the tag to pull it out.  But fear not, this never  happened not even after running, yoga and climbing.  Fortunately for me I have a manicured vagina but a bushy vagina might inevitably mean accidentally tugging on a few hairs which could be quite painful.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning I struggled with the concept of making sure the cup opened inside my vagina, so that it was a tight fit and didn\'t leak. Basically you fold the cup to insert it and once it is inside your cervix it opens up (that sounds way more complicated then it is so please don\'t let it put you off).  Once I followed the instructions carefully and developed a little more confidence this wasn\'t a struggle at all and never had a leak.\r\n\r\nOther than that I did have some weird thoughts about this cup of blood sloshing around inside me especially when I did inversion asanas (shoulder stands) in yoga.  It suddenly made sense why inversion asanas may not be recommend when menstruating.  I tend to remove and empty the cup every 3 to 4 hours but you can leave it in for up to 12 hours.  In fact menstrual cups have a lower risk of TSS http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/menstrual-cup#1 which makes it quite safe.  \r\n\r\nWashing out of the cup isn\'t convenient when you\'re in public places where the sink is outside of the toilet cubicle.  I think the best thing to do is bring a bottle of water with you and wash it into the toilet.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the iCare cup I am wondering if the silicon is a little hard next month I am going to order the Mooncup which emphasises a softer silicon.  I\'ll let you know how I get on. \r\n\r\nI ordered a Mooncup for a whopping £20 (with delivery).  That\'s 5x more expensive then the iCare cup and sadly I preferred the iCare version.  There are two reasons.  One  is that the  Mooncup has a very thick rim of silicon around its top which I presume is to create a snugger fit but I found that made it way more difficult to insert.  Also the Mooncup cup is smaller so the tag sits a little higher which wasn\'t so great, well quite scary in fact.  \r\n\r\nSecond month in and I love menstrual cups.  What a pleasure!  They\'re so convenient, if you think you\'re coming on they fit discreetly in your bag and you only ever need one.  This time around I left the cup in way longer and was quite comfortable with it.  One thing I would recommend though is wearing black panties because you can get a smear or two (though never any leakage!) and you don\'t want to ruin your favourite pair of lingerie. \r\n\r\nI hope you\'ll try a menstrual cup soon.

The reasons were the same as why I had stopped using tampons - I  don\'t like the idea of anything man-made going up my vagina (which is a bit contradictory since I have had 100\'s of condoms up there), I don\'t like the idea of a blood soaked tampon just sitting there and because of the risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) which can occur when a tampon is left in too long.  \r\n\r\nAfter more than 24 months of throwing aways small bags of pads every month I finally decided that I would to give them a go and ordered a £4.50 iCare from ebay.  \r\n\r\nTo my surprise they work really well, no leaks not even when I was bouldering.  Plus, I didn\'t have to endure a week of big panties (for safety) and sitting in blood soaked pads for hours (so gross)!  Plus there\'s no smells!

The experience of inserting a silicon cup up your v-jay-jay certainly does take some getting used too.  Like anyone who has inserted anything up their vagina there is a constant awareness that this must also come out.  The iCare cup has a short pulling bit which sits just inside your vagina so it\'s discreet and doesn\'t get in the way.  This does make it bit scary in the beginning, the thought that the cup may somehow get too high and I wouldn\'t be able to find the tag to pull it out.  But fear not, this never  happened not even after running, yoga and climbing.  Fortunately for me I have a manicured vagina but a bushy vagina might inevitably mean accidentally tugging on a few hairs which could be quite painful.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning I struggled with the concept of making sure the cup opened inside my vagina, so that it was a tight fit and didn\'t leak. Basically you fold the cup to insert it and once it is inside your cervix it opens up (that sounds way more complicated then it is so please don\'t let it put you off).  Once I followed the instructions carefully and developed a little more confidence this wasn\'t a struggle at all and never had a leak.\r\n\r\nOther than that I did have some weird thoughts about this cup of blood sloshing around inside me especially when I did inversion asanas (shoulder stands) in yoga.  It suddenly made sense why inversion asanas may not be recommend when menstruating.  I tend to remove and empty the cup every 3 to 4 hours but you can leave it in for up to 12 hours.  In fact menstrual cups have a lower risk of TSS http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/menstrual-cup#1 which makes it quite safe.  \r\n\r\nWashing out of the cup isn\'t convenient when you\'re in public places where the sink is outside of the toilet cubicle.

Although I knew they were far better for the environment I avoided them.  The reasons were the same as why I had stopped using tampons - I  don\'t like the idea of anything man-made going up my vagina (which is a bit contradictory since I have had 100\'s of condoms up there), I don\'t like the idea of a blood soaked tampon just sitting there and because of the risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) which can occur when a tampon is left in too long.  \r\n\r\nAfter more than 24 months of throwing aways small bags of pads every month I finally decided that I would to give them a go and ordered a £4.50 iCare from ebay.  \r\n\r\nTo my surprise they work really well, no leaks not even when I was bouldering.  Plus, I didn\'t have to endure a week of big panties (for safety) and sitting in blood soaked pads for hours (so gross)!  Plus there\'s no smells!  Considering all these benefits and the one most closest to my heart, lowering my environmental footprint, I cannot understand why we have pads and tampons at all.  Why aren\'t menstrual cups in the grocery stores and why haven\'t pad and tampon companies switched to producing menstrual cups?\r\n\r\nSo how was the iCare menstrual cup?  The experience of inserting a silicon cup up your v-jay-jay certainly does take some getting used too.  Like anyone who has inserted anything up their vagina there is a constant awareness that this must also come out.  The iCare cup has a short pulling bit which sits just inside your vagina so it\'s discreet and doesn\'t get in the way.  This does make it bit scary in the beginning, the thought that the cup may somehow get too high and I wouldn\'t be able to find the tag to pull it out.  But fear not, this never  happened not even after running, yoga and climbing.  Fortunately for me I have a manicured vagina but a bushy vagina might inevitably mean accidentally tugging on a few hairs which could be quite painful.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning I struggled with the concept of making sure the cup opened inside my vagina, so that it was a tight fit and didn\'t leak. Basically you fold the cup to insert it and once it is inside your cervix it opens up (that sounds way more complicated then it is so please don\'t let it put you off).  Once I followed the instructions carefully and developed a little more confidence this wasn\'t a struggle at all and never had a leak.\r\n\r\nOther than that I did have some weird thoughts about this cup of blood sloshing around inside me especially when I did inversion asanas (shoulder stands) in yoga.  It suddenly made sense why inversion asanas may not be recommend when menstruating.  I tend to remove and empty the cup every 3 to 4 hours but you can leave it in for up to 12 hours.  In fact menstrual cups have a lower risk of TSS http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/menstrual-cup#1 which makes it quite safe.  \r\n\r\nWashing out of the cup isn\'t convenient when you\'re in public places where the sink is outside of the toilet cubicle.  I think the best thing to do is bring a bottle of water with you and wash it into the toilet.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the iCare cup I am wondering if the silicon is a little hard next month I am going to order the Mooncup which emphasises a softer silicon.  I\'ll let you know how I get on. \r\n\r\nI ordered a Mooncup for a whopping £20 (with delivery).  That\'s 5x more expensive then the iCare cup and sadly I preferred the iCare version.  There are two reasons.  One  is that the  Mooncup has a very thick rim of silicon around its top which I presume is to create a snugger fit but I found that made it way more difficult to insert.  Also the Mooncup cup is smaller so the tag sits a little higher which wasn\'t so great, well quite scary in fact.  \r\n\r\nSecond month in and I love menstrual cups.  What a pleasure!

Butta looks and tastes like dairy butter.

The coconut oil and cacao butter have been steamed to remove their flavours. Cacao butter is what makes Aya so melty, it also helps it stay hard at room temperature. The safflower oil is cold pressed which is a great way of maintaining its nutritional benefits. Just like cow\'s butter Aya Original is high in fat. Aya Original has 10% lower overall fat than cow\'s butter and 9% less saturated fat.

Although I knew they were far better for the environment I avoided them.  The reasons were the same as why I had stopped using tampons - I  don\'t like the idea of anything man-made going up my vagina (which is a bit contradictory since I have had 100\'s of condoms up there), I don\'t like the idea of a blood soaked tampon just sitting there and because of the risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) which can occur when a tampon is left in too long.  \r\n\r\nAfter more than 24 months of throwing aways small bags of pads every month I finally decided that I would to give them a go and ordered a £4.50 iCare from ebay.  \r\n\r\nTo my surprise they work really well, no leaks not even when I was bouldering.  Plus, I didn\'t have to endure a week of big panties (for safety) and sitting in blood soaked pads for hours (so gross)!  Plus there\'s no smells!  Considering all the benefits of a menstrual cup including the one closest to my heart, reducing environmental waste, why aren\'t pad and tampon companies switching to menstrual cups and why aren\'t these sold in the grocery stores?\r\n\r\nSo how was the iCare menstrual cup?  The experience of inserting a silicon cup up your v-jay-jay certainly does take some getting used too.  Like anyone who has inserted anything up their vagina there is a constant awareness that this must also come out.  The iCare cup has a short pulling bit which sits just inside your vagina so it\'s discreet and doesn\'t get in the way.  This does make it bit scary in the beginning, the thought that the cup may somehow get too high and I wouldn\'t be able to find the tag to pull it out.  But fear not, this never  happened not even after running, yoga and climbing.  Fortunately for me I have a manicured vagina but a bushy vagina might inevitably mean accidentally tugging on a few hairs which could be quite painful.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning I struggled with the concept of making sure the cup opened inside my vagina, so that it was a tight fit and didn\'t leak. Basically you fold the cup to insert it and once it is inside your cervix it opens up (that sounds way more complicated then it is so please don\'t let it put you off).  Once I followed the instructions carefully and developed a little more confidence this wasn\'t a struggle at all and never had a leak.\r\n\r\nOther than that I did have some weird thoughts about this cup of blood sloshing around inside me especially when I did inversion asanas (shoulder stands) in yoga.  It suddenly made sense why inversion asanas may not be recommend when menstruating.  I tend to remove and empty the cup every 3 to 4 hours but you can leave it in for up to 12 hours.  In fact menstrual cups have a lower risk of TSS http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/menstrual-cup#1 which makes it quite safe.  \r\n\r\nWashing out of the cup isn\'t convenient when you\'re in public places where the sink is outside of the toilet cubicle.  I think the best thing to do is bring a bottle of water with you and wash it into the toilet.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the iCare cup I am wondering if the silicon is a little hard next month I am going to order the Mooncup which emphasises a softer silicon.  I\'ll let you know how I get on. \r\n\r\nI ordered a Mooncup for a whopping £20 (with delivery).  That\'s 5x more expensive then the iCare cup and sadly I preferred the iCare version.  There are two reasons.  One  is that the  Mooncup has a very thick rim of silicon around its top which I presume is to create a snugger fit but I found that made it way more difficult to insert.  Also the Mooncup cup is smaller so the tag sits a little higher which wasn\'t so great, well quite scary in fact.  \r\n\r\nSecond month in and I love menstrual cups.  What a pleasure!  They\'re so convenient, if you think you\'re coming on they fit discreetly in your bag and you only ever need one.  This time around I left the cup in way longer and was quite comfortable with it.  One thing I would recommend though is wearing black panties because you can get a smear or two (though never any leakage!) and you don\'t want to ruin your favourite pair of lingerie. \r\n\r\nI hope you\'ll try a menstrual cup soon.  It\'ll be great for the planet and I am sure you will love their benefits too.\r\n\r\n','Are menstrual cups the future?','','inherit','closed','closed','','304-revision-v1','','','2017-11-10 18:00:55','2017-11-10 18:00:55','',304,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/304-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(351,1,'2017-11-13 12:08:22','2017-11-13 12:08:22','','','','inherit','closed','closed','','289-revision-v1','','','2017-11-13 12:08:22','2017-11-13 12:08:22','',289,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/289-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(352,1,'2017-11-13 12:08:48','2017-11-13 12:08:48','','Articles','','inherit','closed','closed','','289-revision-v1','','','2017-11-13 12:08:48','2017-11-13 12:08:48','',289,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/289-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(353,1,'2017-11-13 15:40:05','2017-11-13 15:40:05','We value your feedback as it gives us the opportunity to grow and develop with you in mind, our very reason for existence.\r\nWe would love you to share your opinions, inspiration, photos, questions, recipes, whatever you have in mind so get in touch, we look forward to hearing from you!

The coconut oil and cacao butter have been steamed to remove their flavours. Cacao butter is what makes Aya so melty, it also helps it stay hard at room temperature. The safflower oil is cold pressed which is a great way of maintaining its nutritional benefits. Just like cow\'s butter Aya Original is high in fat.

We understand that the role of work is only one aspect of an individual\'s life and that happiness can only be achieved in a holistic and balanced way of living.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"justify\">As a start-up we realise the importance of creating a profitable business that aligns with our core values.  We must be profitable so that we can pay our employees, provide a comfortable and conducive working environment and pay our investors a fair return on their investment.  Sometimes we may have to make a small compromise on our values but we will always do so with openness and inform you of our decision.

Although I knew they were far better for the environment I avoided them.  The reasons were the same as why I had stopped using tampons - I  don\'t like the idea of anything man-made going up my vagina (which is a bit contradictory since I have had 100\'s of condoms up there), I don\'t like the idea of a blood soaked tampon just sitting there and because of the risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) which can occur when a tampon is left in too long.  \r\n\r\nAfter more than 24 months of throwing aways small bags of pads every month I finally decided that I would to give them a go and ordered a £4.50 iCare from ebay.  \r\n\r\nTo my surprise they work really well, no leaks not even when I was bouldering.  Plus, I didn\'t have to endure a week of big panties (for safety) and sitting in blood soaked pads for hours (so gross)!  Plus there\'s no smells!  Considering all the benefits of a menstrual cup including the one closest to my heart, reducing environmental waste, why aren\'t pad and tampon companies switching to menstrual cups and why aren\'t these sold in the grocery stores?\r\n\r\nSo how was the iCare menstrual cup?  The experience of inserting a silicon cup up your v-jay-jay certainly does take some getting used too.  Like anyone who has inserted anything up their vagina there is a constant awareness that this must also come out.  The iCare cup has a short pulling bit which sits just inside your vagina so it\'s discreet and doesn\'t get in the way.  This does make it bit scary in the beginning, the thought that the cup may somehow get too high and I wouldn\'t be able to find the tag to pull it out.  But fear not, this never  happened not even after running, yoga and climbing.  Fortunately for me I have a manicured vagina but a bushy vagina might inevitably mean accidentally tugging on a few hairs which could be quite painful.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning I struggled with the concept of making sure the cup opened inside my vagina, so that it was a tight fit and didn\'t leak. Basically you fold the cup to insert it and once it is inside your cervix it opens up (that sounds way more complicated then it is so please don\'t let it put you off).  Once I followed the instructions carefully and developed a little more confidence this wasn\'t a struggle at all and never had a leak.\r\n\r\nOther than that I did have some weird thoughts about this cup of blood sloshing around inside me especially when I did inversion asanas (shoulder stands) in yoga.  It suddenly made sense why inversion asanas may not be recommend when menstruating.  I tend to remove and empty the cup every 3 to 4 hours but you can leave it in for up to 12 hours.  In fact menstrual cups have a lower risk of TSS http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/menstrual-cup#1 which makes it quite safe.  \r\n\r\nWashing out of the cup isn\'t convenient when you\'re in public places where the sink is outside of the toilet cubicle.  I think the best thing to do is bring a bottle of water with you and wash it into the toilet.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the iCare cup I am wondering if the silicon is a little hard next month I am going to order the Mooncup which emphasises a softer silicon.  I\'ll let you know how I get on. \r\n\r\nI ordered a Mooncup for a whopping £20 (with delivery).  That\'s 5x more expensive then the iCare cup and sadly I preferred the iCare version.  There are two reasons.  One  is that the  Mooncup has a very thick rim of silicon around its top which I presume is to create a snugger fit but I found that made it way more difficult to insert.  Also the Mooncup cup is smaller so the tag sits a little higher which wasn\'t so great, well quite scary in fact.  \r\n\r\nSecond month in and I love menstrual cups.  What a pleasure!  They\'re so convenient, if you think you\'re coming on they fit discreetly in your bag and you only ever need one.  This time around I left the cup in way longer and was quite comfortable with it.  One thing I would recommend though is wearing black panties because you can get a smear or two (though never any leakage!) and you don\'t want to ruin your favourite pair of lingerie. \r\n\r\nI hope you\'ll try a menstrual cup soon.  It\'ll be great for the planet and I am sure you will love their benefits too.\r\n\r\n','Are menstrual cups the future?','','inherit','closed','closed','','304-revision-v1','','','2017-11-15 14:26:38','2017-11-15 14:26:38','',304,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/304-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(388,1,'2017-11-15 20:34:14','2017-11-15 20:34:14','<p>Aya has been created out of a need to live and work authentically with a vision of earning a fair livelihood whilst contributing positively to society.

Aya Original is made as the closest plant alternative to cow\'s butter.\r\n\r\nAya Original is made with 6 organic, non-GMO ingredients and contains no palm-oil. The plant oils in Aya Original are coconut oil, cacao butter and safflower oil. The coconut oil and cacao butter have been steamed to remove their flavours. Cacao butter is what makes Aya so melty, it also helps it stay hard at room temperature. The safflower oil is cold pressed which is a great way of maintaining its nutritional benefits.\r\n\r\nAya Original is great for spreading, my favourite is on warm toast. It\'s also a great alternative to for cooking and baking.\r\n<h3>Dietary and lifestyle</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ayaList\">\r\n 	<li>ONLY ORGANIC INGREDIENTS</li>\r\n 	<li>No PALM OIL</li>\r\n 	<li>No GMO INGREDIENTS</li>\r\n 	<li>No DAIRY OR LACTOSE</li>\r\n 	<li>Suitable for VEGANS and VEGETARIANS</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\r\nOrganic steamed coconut oil, organic steamed cocoa butter, organic cold-pressed safflower oil , spring water, Himalayan pink salt , organic sunflower lecithin (vegetable fat 71%)\r\n<h3>Typical nutritional values per 100g</h3>\r\n<table class=\"table table-striped\"><colgroup> <col /> <col /></colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Typical values</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Per 100g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Energy (kJ/kCal)</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">2636 / 636</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Total fat</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">71g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Saturated</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">42g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Carbohydrates</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">0g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Sugar</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">0g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Fibre</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">0g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Protein</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">0g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Salt</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">1.34g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h3>How is Aya Original made?</h3>\r\n<p>The oils are melted to liquid form.

Aya Original is made as the closest plantbased alternative to cow\'s butter.\r\n\r\nAya Original is made with 6 organic, non-GMO ingredients and contains no palm-oil. The plant oils in Aya Original are coconut oil, cacao butter and safflower oil. The coconut oil and cacao butter have been steamed to remove their flavours. Cacao butter is what makes Aya so melty, it also helps it stay hard at room temperature. The safflower oil is cold pressed which is a great way of maintaining its nutritional benefits.\r\n\r\nAya Original is great for spreading, my favourite is on warm toast. It\'s also a great alternative to for cooking and baking.\r\n<h3>Dietary and lifestyle</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ayaList\">\r\n 	<li>ONLY ORGANIC INGREDIENTS</li>\r\n 	<li>No PALM OIL</li>\r\n 	<li>No GMO INGREDIENTS</li>\r\n 	<li>No DAIRY OR LACTOSE</li>\r\n 	<li>Suitable for VEGANS and VEGETARIANS</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\r\nOrganic steamed coconut oil, organic steamed cocoa butter, organic cold-pressed safflower oil , spring water, Himalayan pink salt , organic sunflower lecithin (vegetable fat 71%)\r\n<h3>Typical nutritional values per 100g</h3>\r\n<table class=\"table table-striped\"><colgroup> <col /> <col /></colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Typical values</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Per 100g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Energy (kJ/kCal)</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">2636 / 636</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Total fat</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">71g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Saturated</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">42g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Carbohydrates</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">0g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Sugar</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">0g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Fibre</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">0g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Protein</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">0g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Salt</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">1.34g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h3>How is Aya Original made?</h3>\r\n<p>The oils are melted to liquid form.

Our organic steamed coconut oil is from <a href=\"http://biona.co.uk/\">Biona</a> whose coconut oils originate from SriLanka and the Philippines. Our organic cold-pressed safflower oil is from <a href=\"http://www.meridianfoods.co.uk/\">Meridian</a> and originates from India.</p>\r\n<h3>What are the health risks associated with Aya Original?</h3>\r\n<p>Aya Original contains 10% less overall fat and 9% less saturated fat then cow\'s butter. Aya Original has a total fat content of 71%, of which 42% is saturated fat. Coconut oil and cocoa butter are the main contributors to the saturated fat content. Safflower oil is a healthy fat composed of predominantly poly-unsaturated fat. Aya Original should be consumed responsibly as eating high levels of saturated fat can raise your cholesterol and increase your risk of heart disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aya Original contains 0.7% sunflower lecithin which makes it creamy and spreadable. Sunflower lecithin contains &lt;1g of trans-fat per 100g.</p>','Products','','inherit','closed','closed','','343-revision-v1','','','2017-11-24 16:45:19','2017-11-24 16:45:19','',343,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/343-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(462,1,'2017-11-24 16:52:38','2017-11-24 16:52:38','<h2>Aya Original</h2>\r\n<p>Aya Original is the closest plantbased alternative to cow\'s butter.

I found the whole event quite stressful. My decision to be an active participant meant that from the start I had made myself vulnerable to success or failure. When I was forced to face the rejection of my first pitch it was a very difficult time. I wasn\'t able to stay present, to be in the moment. I found myself creating illusions about how the other participants perceived me, slipping back into old stories of victimhood. It took me a while to find my strength and inner-worth. I kept breathing, pulling myself back to the here and now and thankfully I did recover and focused on helping my team pitch our idea. Unfortunately our idea didn\'t win or come second.</p>\r\n<blockquote class=\"inline-quote\">\r\n<p>We can create a new culture where individuals are inspired to try without fear and the stigma of failure</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">On the way home at the end of the event I started to think about the differences between success and failure. My understanding of success and failure is that it is based on achieving a goal, an aim or a purpose. In competitive scenarios the successor is the one who comes closest to achieving the goal, aim or purpose. It makes sense then that the first thing we need to do is clearly understand the goal and then ensure that our plan of action is directed at achieving this. I realised that I hadn\'t taken the time to understand the point system that the judges were using to evaluate the winner; I was never going to be successful without this knowledge.</p>\r\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-487\" src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/successfailure.jpg\" alt=\"successfailure\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">We all know that failure is inevitable, it is part of life. Some say that failure is the key to success and perhaps that is true but only in so far as you choose to learn from failure. If failure has you feeling so hurt and disheartened that you decide not to expose yourself and give up then it won\'t help you succeed. With this in mind we must choose our goal, aim or purpose carefully. If we are passionate about achieving our goal, aim or purpose because we know that it will bring us lasting fulfilment, satisfaction and happiness then we are more likely to learn from our failures allowing them to further motivate us to try again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"justify\">Perhaps the biggest difference between success and failure is our response to it. I imagined how my team would have responded if we had been successful. We would have glowed with pride and smiled with accomplishment. We would have praised each other on our efforts, quickly forgetting the difficulties that we had faced. We would have been open to integrating with other participants, taking praise and talking about how and what we had done to achieve our success. And how did we act in failure? We were outwardly sympathetic towards our team members. We were introvert, retrospective, critical and analytical. We wanted to to expose the weeds and acknowledge the areas of weakness. We made comparisons about the validity of our idea compared with those that were successful, keen to discover the key to their success.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"inline-quote\">\r\n<p>We can glow with pride and smile with accomplishment because we gave it a go, because without those that try, those that are willing to expose themselves and make themselves vulnerable, humanity will not progress</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">When I think about success and failure they are two sides to the same coin. In both scenarios we have a vision, set a goal, make a plan and execute it. It is only the final outcome that is different. I believe that the best thing we can do to alleviate the suffering we create around failure is to respond to failure as we do in success. If we can fail in the knowledge that we will learn from our mistakes, then we can create a new culture where individuals are inspired to try without fear and the stigma of failure. <span class=\"emphasis\">If in failure we can be equally retrospective and analytical about our strengths and our weaknesses, then we can play a better, stronger hand and we can celebrate our strengths despite failure. And just as importantly, if in success we can maintain humility, if we reject feelings of superiority, grandiosity and importance and if we respond just as we do in failure then we narrow the gap between success and failure, and we highlight the significance and importance of the journey rather than the achievement of a goal.</span></p>','Success is failure turned inside out','','publish','open','open','','the-difference-between-success-and-failure','','','2018-09-20 16:44:42','2018-09-20 16:44:42','',0,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/?p=463',0,'post','',0),(464,1,'2017-11-29 17:55:46','2017-11-29 17:55:46','','The difference between success and failure','','inherit','closed','closed','','463-revision-v1','','','2017-11-29 17:55:46','2017-11-29 17:55:46','',463,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/463-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(465,1,'2017-11-29 18:42:35','2017-11-29 18:42:35','','The difference between success and failure','','inherit','closed','closed','','463-revision-v1','','','2017-11-29 18:42:35','2017-11-29 18:42:35','',463,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/463-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(467,1,'2017-11-29 18:47:53','2017-11-29 18:47:53','','The difference between success and failure','','inherit','closed','closed','','463-revision-v1','','','2017-11-29 18:47:53','2017-11-29 18:47:53','',463,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/463-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(468,1,'2017-11-29 18:48:41','2017-11-29 18:48:41','I recently attended a competitive 2 day event based around creating an investable business opportunity that met UN\'s SDG12 (sustainable development goal) - responsible consumption and production. This was an opportunity for me to learn more about business, sustainability in business and to interact with like minded people.\r\n\r\nOnce the event kicked off I spontaneously decided to pitch my potential business, Aya. With this mind-set I immediately became an active participant. I found myself trying to recruit participants to join my team, intently encouraging ideas and interest.\r\n\r\nThe pitch phase arrived. Everyone was given 3 elastic bands. Once all 10 of us had presented our 30 second pitch participants were given an opportunity to give away their elastic bands to the pitches they were most interested in.\r\n\r\nPresenting the pitch was obviously quite stressful, as everyone knows public speaking isn\'t easy especially when you haven\'t had a lot of practice. What was even more stressful was standing around waiting for participants to hand over their elastic bands. I got two elastic bands, an abysmal performance considering their were approximately 150 elastic bands available. Suffice to say my pitch didn\'t make the final 7.\r\n\r\nOnce we had all formed teams around the winning 7 pitches we started the hard work of creating an investable business opportunity that met SDG12. The following morning we returned knowing that our presentations needed to be completed by lunch time. It was a test of team work, collaboration, compromise, clear communication and good business acumen. Finally we were all ready to pitch to our investors. Each pitch was 4 minutes followed by a short Q & A with the judges. Once all the pitches had been presented the judges deliberated and returned with a winner and a runner-up. Unfortunately our team was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nI found the whole event very stressful.

With this in mind the first thing we need to do to be successful is clearly understand the goal, aim or purpose.  I realised that I had paid no attention to the point system that has been assigned to the pitches.  How will I ever be successful if I don\'t keep the goal clearly in mind?\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the biggest difference between success and failure is our response to it.  I imagined how my team would have responded if we had been successful.  We would have glowed with pride and smiled with accomplishment.  We would have praised each other on our efforts, quickly forgetting the difficulties that we had faced.  We would have been open to integrating with other participants, taking praise and talking about how and what we had done to achieve our success.\r\nAnd how did we act in failure?  We were outwardly sympathetic towards our team members.  We were introvert, retrospective, critical and analytical.  We wanted to to expose the weeds and acknowledge the areas of weakness.  We made comparisons about the validity of our idea compared with those that were successful, keen to discover the key to their success. \r\n\r\nWe all know that failure is inevitable, it is a part of life.  Some say that failure is the key to success and perhaps that is true but only in so far as you choose to learn from your failure.  If failure has you feeling so hurt and disheartened that you decide not to expose yourself  and give up then it won\'t help you succeed.  With this in mind we must choose our goal, aim or purpose carefully.  If we are passionate about achieving our goal, aim or purpose because we know that it will bring us lasting fulfilment, satisfaction and happiness then we are more likely to learn from our failures allowing them to further motivate us to try again.\r\n\r\nThe best thing we can do to alleviate the suffering we create around failure is to respond to it the same as success.  We can glow with pride and smile with accomplishment because we gave it a try, because without those that try, those that are willing to expose themselves and make themselves vulnerable humanity will not progress.  If we can fail with a smile on our face in the knowledge that we will learn from our mistakes, then we can create a new culture where individuals are inspired to try without fear and stigma of failure.  If in failure we can be equally retrospective and analytical about our strengths and our weaknesses then having identified our strengths we can play a better, stronger hand and we can celebrate our strengths despite failure.\r\n\r\nAnd just as importantly, if in success we can maintain humility, if we reject feelings of superiority, grandiosity and importance and if we respond just as we do in failure then we narrow the gap between success and failure and we highlight the significance and importance of the journey rather than the achievement of a goal, aim or purpose.','The difference between success and failure','','inherit','closed','closed','','463-revision-v1','','','2017-11-29 18:51:59','2017-11-29 18:51:59','',463,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/463-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(473,1,'2017-11-29 18:53:56','2017-11-29 18:53:56','I recently attended a competitive 2 day event based around creating an investable business opportunity that met UN\'s SDG12 (sustainable development goal)  - responsible consumption and production.  This was an opportunity for me to learn more about business, sustainability in business and to interact with like minded people.\r\n\r\nOnce the event kicked off  I spontaneously decided to pitch my potential business, Aya.    With this mind-set I immediately became an active participant.  I found myself trying to recruit participants to join my team, intently encouraging ideas and interest.\r\n\r\nThe pitch phase arrived.  Everyone was given 3 elastic bands.  Once all 10 of us had presented our 30 second pitch participants were given an opportunity to give away their elastic bands to the pitches they were most interested in.  \r\n\r\nPresenting the pitch was obviously quite stressful, as everyone knows public speaking isn\'t easy especially when you haven\'t had a lot of practice.  What was even more stressful was standing around waiting for participants to hand over their elastic bands.  I got two elastic bands, an abysmal performance considering their were approximately 150 elastic bands available.  Suffice to say my pitch didn\'t make the final 7.\r\n\r\nOnce we had all formed teams around the winning 7 pitches we started the hard work of creating an investable business opportunity that met SDG12.  The following morning we returned knowing that our presentations needed to be completed by lunch time.  It was a test of team work, collaboration, compromise, clear communication and good business acumen.  Finally we were all ready to pitch to our investors.  Each pitch was 4 minutes followed by a short Q & A with the judges.  Once all the pitches had been presented the judges deliberated and returned with a winner and a runner-up.  Unfortunately our team was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nI found the whole event very stressful.  My decision to be an active participant meant that from the start I had made myself vulnerable to success or failure.  When I was forced to face the rejection of my first pitch it was a very difficult time.  I wasn\'t able to stay present, to be in the moment.  I found myself creating illusions about how the other participants perceived me, slipping back into old stories of victimhood.  It took me a while to find my strength and inner worth.

We would have been open to integrating with other participants, taking praise and talking about how and what we had done to achieve our success. And how did we act in failure?

The coconut oil and cacao butter have been steamed to remove their flavours. Cacao butter is what makes Aya so melty, it also helps it stay hard at room temperature. The safflower oil is cold pressed which is a great way of maintaining its nutritional benefits.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Organic steamed coconut oil, organic steamed cocoa butter, organic cold-pressed safflower oil , spring water, Himalayan pink salt , organic sunflower lecithin</strong> (vegetable fat spread 71%)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Typical nutritional values per 100g</h3>\r\n<table class=\"table table-striped\"><colgroup> <col /> <col /></colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Typical values</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Per 100g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Energy (kJ/kCal)</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">2636 / 636</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Total fat</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">71g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Saturated</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">42g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Carbohydrates</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">0g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Sugar</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">0g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Fibre</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">0g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Protein</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">0g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\r\n<td width=\"50%\">Salt</td>\r\n<td width=\"50%\">1.34g</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h3>How is Aya Original made?</h3>\r\n<p>The oils are melted to liquid form. Whilst cooling the oils are blended with spring water, salt and a small amount of sunflower lecithin. They are poured into moulds and set in the fridge. <img title=\"Moulds\" src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_1699-opt.png\" /></p>\r\n<h3>Where are Aya Original\'s ingredients from?</h3>\r\n<p>We source our organic steamed cocoa butter from <a href=\"https://www.realfoodsource.com/\">RealFoodSource</a> who import the cacao from Dominican Republic. Our organic steamed coconut oil is from <a href=\"http://biona.co.uk/\">Biona</a> whose coconut oils originate from SriLanka and the Philippines. Our organic cold-pressed safflower oil is from <a href=\"http://www.meridianfoods.co.uk/\">Meridian</a> and originates from India.</p>\r\n<h3>What are the health risks associated with Aya Original?</h3>\r\n<p>Aya Original contains 10% less overall fat and 9% less saturated fat then cow\'s butter. Aya Original has a total fat content of 71%, of which 42% is saturated fat. Coconut oil and cocoa butter are the main contributors to the saturated fat content. Safflower oil is a healthy fat composed of predominantly poly-unsaturated fat. Aya Original should be consumed responsibly as eating high levels of saturated fat can raise your cholesterol and increase your risk of heart disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aya Original contains 0.7% sunflower lecithin which makes it creamy and spreadable. Sunflower lecithin contains &lt;1g of trans-fat per 100g.</p>','Products','','inherit','closed','closed','','343-revision-v1','','','2018-09-01 10:21:37','2018-09-01 10:21:37','',343,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/343-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(530,1,'2018-09-01 10:21:45','2018-09-01 10:21:45','<p>We believe that our business should hold your values in our highest regard so that you can rest assured that your money is being used for the highest good.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a conscious business we are prioritising transparency and social responsibility:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ayaList\">\r\n<li>Aya believes that a diet rich in plant-strong foods is a better way for us to take care of ourselves and the planet.

Our organic steamed coconut oil is from <a href=\"http://biona.co.uk/\">Biona</a> whose coconut oils originate from SriLanka and the Philippines. Our organic cold-pressed safflower oil is from <a href=\"http://www.meridianfoods.co.uk/\">Meridian</a> and originates from India.</p>\r\n<h3>What are the health risks associated with Aya Original?</h3>\r\n<p>Aya Original contains 10% less overall fat and 9% less saturated fat then cow\'s butter. Aya Original has a total fat content of 71%, of which 42% is saturated fat. Coconut oil and cocoa butter are the main contributors to the saturated fat content. Safflower oil is a healthy fat composed of predominantly poly-unsaturated fat. Aya Original should be consumed responsibly as eating high levels of saturated fat can raise your cholesterol and increase your risk of heart disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aya Original contains 0.7% sunflower lecithin which makes it creamy and spreadable. Sunflower lecithin contains &lt;1g of trans-fat per 100g.</p>','Products','','inherit','closed','closed','','343-revision-v1','','','2018-09-04 15:11:03','2018-09-04 15:11:03','',343,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/343-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(570,1,'2018-09-04 15:11:25','2018-09-04 15:11:25','<h2>Aya Original</h2>\r\n<img src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/aya-product-2.png\" alt=\"aya-product-2\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-567\" />\r\n<p>Aya Original our closest organic plantbased alternative to dairy butter.

I made the decision for ethical reasons due to my concerns with the mistreatment of animals in the meat and dairy industry as well as the strain that animal agriculture and chemicals have on the environment.</p>\r\n<p>Initially this was a relaxed decision, however as the years have gone by I am finding it increasingly difficult to eat meat, dairy or un-organic food.</p>\r\n<p>Eating a vegan diet has an interesting learning curve.  One has to meet all their nutritional requirements without meat or dairy sources.  It\'s not impossible but it does take some careful choices and a clear understanding of the nutrients we need and in what foods they are found.  It also requires listening to your body and noticing when things aren\'t quite right.</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve noticed that I depend on  lots of \'exotic\' ingredients that aren\'t sourced locally.  Things like hemp seeds, chia seeds and Spirulina.  In fact most of my protein sources like chickpeas, kidney beans, quinoa and lentils are not sourced locally.  It has me wondering if I am creating a bigger carbon footprint than if I just ate locally sourced ingredients which might include meat and dairy.</p>\r\n<p>The point is that if it were proven that my carbon footprint was larger than if I ate locally sourced foods I would need to reconsider my choices.  Which brings me back to the difficulty I have eating meat, dairy or un-organic food.  Have I become identified with being vegan?  Does it give me satisfaction to say \'I\'m vegan\'?  Do I think I am better than others and judge them because they aren\'t vegan?  Being identified with veganism is of little benefit as it means that I have become closed to new information and defensive about my opinions.</p>\r\n<p>That\'s why I believe that eating consciously is most important.  It\'s not about making judgements or identifications, its about doing what\' right for the greatest good.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span>In every truth the opposite is equally true. That is to say, any truth can only be expressed and put into words when it is one-sided. Everything that can be thought with the mind and said with words is one-sided, it\'s all just the half of it, lacking completeness, roundness, or unity.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse</p>','Nothing is black or white','','inherit','closed','closed','','131-revision-v1','','','2018-09-06 15:47:58','2018-09-06 15:47:58','',131,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/131-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(597,1,'2018-09-06 15:48:32','2018-09-06 15:48:32','Published in Barefoot Vegan magazine October 2016 edition. <a href=\"http://www.barefootvegan.com/magazine.html\">Subscribe to Barefoot Vegan magazine</a>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-77\" src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Barefoot-vegan-extract-212x300.jpg\" sizes=\"85vw\" alt=\"Barefoot-vegan-extract\" />','To Hell With Recycling I Want Reuse','','inherit','closed','closed','','10-revision-v1','','','2018-09-06 15:48:32','2018-09-06 15:48:32','',10,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/10-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(598,1,'2018-09-06 15:48:46','2018-09-06 15:48:46','I recently attended a competitive 2 day event based around creating an investable business opportunity. I found the whole event quite stressful. My decision to be an active participant meant that from the start I had made myself vulnerable to success or failure. When I was forced to face the rejection of my first pitch it was a very difficult time. I wasn\'t able to stay present, to be in the moment. I found myself creating illusions about how the other participants perceived me, slipping back into old stories of victimhood. It took me a while to find my strength and inner worth. I kept breathing, pulling myself back to the here and now and thankfully I did recover and focused on helping my team pitch our idea. Unfortunately our idea didn\'t win or come second.\r\n\r\nOn the way home at the end of the event I started to think about the differences between success and failure. My understanding of success and failure is that it is based on achieving a goal, an aim or a purpose. In competitive scenarios the successor is the one who comes closest to achieving the goal, aim or purpose. It makes sense then that the first thing we need to do is clearly understand the goal and then ensure that our plan of action is directed at achieving this. I realised that I hadn\'t taken the time to understand the point system that the judges were using to evaluate the winner; I was never going to be successful without this knowledge.\r\n<div class=\"col-md-14 col-sm-14 col-xs-14\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-487\" src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/successfailure.jpg\" alt=\"successfailure\" width=\"717\" height=\"388\" />\r\n\r\n</div>\r\nWe all know that failure is inevitable, it is part of life. Some say that failure is the key to success and perhaps that is true but only in so far as you choose to learn from failure. If failure has you feeling so hurt and disheartened that you decide not to expose yourself and give up then it won\'t help you succeed. With this in mind we must choose our goal, aim or purpose carefully. If we are passionate about achieving our goal, aim or purpose because we know that it will bring us lasting fulfilment, satisfaction and happiness then we are more likely to learn from our failures allowing them to further motivate us to try again.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest difference between success and failure is our response to it. I imagined how my team would have responded if we had been successful. We would have glowed with pride and smiled with accomplishment. We would have praised each other on our efforts, quickly forgetting the difficulties that we had faced. We would have been open to integrating with other participants, taking praise and talking about how and what we had done to achieve our success. And how did we act in failure? We were outwardly sympathetic towards our team members. We were introvert, retrospective, critical and analytical. We wanted to to expose the weeds and acknowledge the areas of weakness. We made comparisons about the validity of our idea compared with those that were successful, keen to discover the key to their success.\r\n\r\nWhen I think about success and failure they are two sides to the same coin. In both scenarios we have a vision, set a goal, make a plan and execute it. It is only the final outcome that is different. I believe that the best thing we can do to alleviate the suffering we create around failure is to respond to failure as we do in success. We can glow with pride and smile with accomplishment because we gave it a go, because without those that try, those that are willing to expose themselves and make themselves vulnerable humanity will not progress. If we can fail in the knowledge that we will learn from our mistakes, then we can create a new culture where individuals are inspired to try without fear and the stigma of failure. If in failure we can be equally retrospective and analytical about our strengths and our weaknesses then we can play a better, stronger hand and we can celebrate our strengths despite failure. And just as importantly, if in success we can maintain humility, if we reject feelings of superiority, grandiosity and importance and if we respond just as we do in failure then we narrow the gap between success and failure and we highlight the significance and importance of the journey rather than the achievement of a goal.','The difference between success and failure','','inherit','closed','closed','','463-revision-v1','','','2018-09-06 15:48:46','2018-09-06 15:48:46','',463,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/463-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(599,1,'2018-09-06 15:58:04','2018-09-06 15:58:04','<p>I have been consuming a vegan and organic diet for the past two years.

Everyone I met was raving about his Satsangs, but unfortunately he left before I had a chance to hear him speak.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to England I went to a gig in north London to see <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/samgarrettmusic\">Sam Garrett</a> who turned out to be a Mooji devotee, his music is beautiful and he mentioned Mooji numerous times during the performance. So the seed had been sown and I knew I needed to find out more about this <em>Mooji</em>.  I discovered his Ashram was in Portugal and there was an upcoming 10 day silent retreat. The retreat was in such high demand that places were offered via lottery.  I entered and to my surprise I got a place.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-127\" src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/montesahaja1-300x200.jpg\" sizes=\"85vw\" alt=\"montesahaja1\" />\r\n\r\nMoojis\' ashram is <a href=\"http://mooji.org/monte-sahaja/\">Monte Sahaja</a> in southern Portugal and every grain of sand is imbibed with love. He has created heaven on earth where those inclined can spend time to discover their true nature. The format of the retreat is to attend 2 Satsangs a day, which last around 3 hours.  It is  during this Satsangs that Mooji transmits to you the Truth. His style is wonderful, blending wisdom, humour and love and I found myself totally immersed. The rest of the day is spend in contemplation around the ashram.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-106 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shiva-300x200.jpg\" sizes=\"85vw\" alt=\"View from Shiva temple\" />\r\n\r\nHis teaching is simple and direct, simply that you are the Self and that you do not need any practices to achieve this, you need only recognise it. This appears too simple initially, but he guides you through the reactions of your mind to this Truth and as you sit in this space you begin to realise that this space is who you are, who you have always been and who you will always be, the timeless witness to the events which occur within your life and beyond.\r\n<blockquote>That which says:\r\n\r\nMy mind is too strong,\r\n\r\nis the mind itself.\r\n\r\nAn illusion strengthened by belief.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-107\" src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lotusgarden2-300x300.jpg\" sizes=\"85vw\" alt=\"lotusgarden2\" />\r\n\r\nHere is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ui3vIvymDE\">recording</a> from one of his Satsangs','When I met Mooji ..','','inherit','closed','closed','','103-revision-v1','','','2018-09-17 12:29:50','2018-09-17 12:29:50','',103,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/103-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(619,1,'2018-09-17 12:57:15','2018-09-17 12:57:15','<img src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/aya-product-2.png\" alt=\"aya-product-2\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-567\" />\r\n<h2>Aya Original</h2>\r\n<p>Aya Original is our first offering.

I found the whole event quite stressful. My decision to be an active participant meant that from the start I had made myself vulnerable to success or failure. When I was forced to face the rejection of my first pitch it was a very difficult time. I wasn\'t able to stay present, to be in the moment. I found myself creating illusions about how the other participants perceived me, slipping back into old stories of victimhood. It took me a while to find my strength and inner worth. I kept breathing, pulling myself back to the here and now and thankfully I did recover and focused on helping my team pitch our idea. Unfortunately our idea didn\'t win or come second.\r\n\r\nOn the way home at the end of the event I started to think about the differences between success and failure. My understanding of success and failure is that it is based on achieving a goal, an aim or a purpose. In competitive scenarios the successor is the one who comes closest to achieving the goal, aim or purpose. It makes sense then that the first thing we need to do is clearly understand the goal and then ensure that our plan of action is directed at achieving this. I realised that I hadn\'t taken the time to understand the point system that the judges were using to evaluate the winner; I was never going to be successful without this knowledge.\r\n<div class=\"col-md-14 col-sm-14 col-xs-14\">\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-487\" src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/successfailure.jpg\" alt=\"successfailure\" width=\"717\" height=\"388\" />\r\n\r\n</div>\r\nWe all know that failure is inevitable, it is part of life. Some say that failure is the key to success and perhaps that is true but only in so far as you choose to learn from failure. If failure has you feeling so hurt and disheartened that you decide not to expose yourself and give up then it won\'t help you succeed. With this in mind we must choose our goal, aim or purpose carefully. If we are passionate about achieving our goal, aim or purpose because we know that it will bring us lasting fulfilment, satisfaction and happiness then we are more likely to learn from our failures allowing them to further motivate us to try again.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest difference between success and failure is our response to it. I imagined how my team would have responded if we had been successful. We would have glowed with pride and smiled with accomplishment. We would have praised each other on our efforts, quickly forgetting the difficulties that we had faced. We would have been open to integrating with other participants, taking praise and talking about how and what we had done to achieve our success. And how did we act in failure? We were outwardly sympathetic towards our team members. We were introvert, retrospective, critical and analytical. We wanted to to expose the weeds and acknowledge the areas of weakness. We made comparisons about the validity of our idea compared with those that were successful, keen to discover the key to their success.\r\n\r\nWhen I think about success and failure they are two sides to the same coin. In both scenarios we have a vision, set a goal, make a plan and execute it. It is only the final outcome that is different. I believe that the best thing we can do to alleviate the suffering we create around failure is to respond to failure as we do in success. We can glow with pride and smile with accomplishment because we gave it a go, because without those that try, those that are willing to expose themselves and make themselves vulnerable humanity will not progress. If we can fail in the knowledge that we will learn from our mistakes, then we can create a new culture where individuals are inspired to try without fear and the stigma of failure. If in failure we can be equally retrospective and analytical about our strengths and our weaknesses then we can play a better, stronger hand and we can celebrate our strengths despite failure. And just as importantly, if in success we can maintain humility, if we reject feelings of superiority, grandiosity and importance and if we respond just as we do in failure then we narrow the gap between success and failure and we highlight the significance and importance of the journey rather than the achievement of a goal.','The difference between success and failure','','inherit','closed','closed','','463-revision-v1','','','2018-09-18 14:01:57','2018-09-18 14:01:57','',463,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/463-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(634,1,'2018-09-18 14:03:46','2018-09-18 14:03:46','<p class=\"r-align\">14th October 2016</p>\r\n<p>I have been consuming a vegan and organic diet for the past two years.

Aya must be profitable so that we can pay our employees a decent wage and to provide a comfortable and conducive working environment, additionally we must give our investors a fair return on their investment because they were the first ones to believe in our business and it\'s purpose.  To exist profitably we must assess all our activities on a case-by-case basis and decide what is the best choice considering the circumstances.  Sometimes we may have to make compromises but we will always do so with openness and transparency and we will consistently reassess our decisions in a timely manner.  Once we grow and make an impact we will be able to make more demands that align with our values but we will need your loyalty to get there.  Here is what we have implemented so far and below that is what we will implement next:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We only use <span class=\"emphasis\">non-GMO, organic ingredients</span> because we believe that food should be natural and we do not advocate any chemicals used in the growing, cultivation or processing of our ingredients</li>\r\n<li>We choose <span class=\"emphasis\">no palm-oil</span> because of the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TQQXstNh45g\">catastrophic effects that palm-oil cultivation has had on our rain forests and their inhabitants</a></li>\r\n<li>We will never use plastic, we choose to <span class=\"emphasis\">package our plantbutters in compostable greaseproof paper</span> because this has the lowest environmental impact.  We encourage butter dishes as a way of preserving your butter in the fridge.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Once we are trading profitably we will implement the following</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We will be a <a href=\"https://bcorporation.net/\">Certified B Corporation</a>.  Certified B Corporations meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability.

I found the whole event quite stressful. My decision to be an active participant meant that from the start I had made myself vulnerable to success or failure. When I was forced to face the rejection of my first pitch it was a very difficult time. I wasn\'t able to stay present, to be in the moment. I found myself creating illusions about how the other participants perceived me, slipping back into old stories of victimhood. It took me a while to find my strength and inner worth.

My understanding of success and failure is that it is based on achieving a goal, an aim or a purpose. In competitive scenarios the successor is the one who comes closest to achieving the goal, aim or purpose. It makes sense then that the first thing we need to do is clearly understand the goal and then ensure that our plan of action is directed at achieving this.

Some say that failure is the key to success and perhaps that is true but only in so far as you choose to learn from failure. If failure has you feeling so hurt and disheartened that you decide not to expose yourself and give up then it won\'t help you succeed. With this in mind we must choose our goal, aim or purpose carefully. If we are passionate about achieving our goal, aim or purpose because we know that it will bring us lasting fulfilment, satisfaction and happiness then we are more likely to learn from our failures allowing them to further motivate us to try again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"justify\">Perhaps the biggest difference between success and failure is our response to it. I imagined how my team would have responded if we had been successful. We would have glowed with pride and smiled with accomplishment. We would have praised each other on our efforts, quickly forgetting the difficulties that we had faced. We would have been open to integrating with other participants, taking praise and talking about how and what we had done to achieve our success. And how did we act in failure? We were outwardly sympathetic towards our team members. We were introvert, retrospective, critical and analytical. We wanted to to expose the weeds and acknowledge the areas of weakness.

In both scenarios we have a vision, set a goal, make a plan and execute it. It is only the final outcome that is different. I believe that the best thing we can do to alleviate the suffering we create around failure is to respond to failure as we do in success. We can glow with pride and smile with accomplishment because we gave it a go, because without those that try, those that are willing to expose themselves and make themselves vulnerable humanity will not progress. If we can fail in the knowledge that we will learn from our mistakes, then we can create a new culture where individuals are inspired to try without fear and the stigma of failure. If in failure we can be equally retrospective and analytical about our strengths and our weaknesses then we can play a better, stronger hand and we can celebrate our strengths despite failure. And just as importantly, if in success we can maintain humility, if we reject feelings of superiority, grandiosity and importance and if we respond just as we do in failure then we narrow the gap between success and failure and we highlight the significance and importance of the journey rather than the achievement of a goal.</p>','The difference between success and failure','','inherit','closed','closed','','463-revision-v1','','','2018-09-19 12:33:22','2018-09-19 12:33:22','',463,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/463-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(676,1,'2018-09-19 12:37:58','2018-09-19 12:37:58','<p class=\"r-align\">29th November 2017</p>\r\n<p class=\"justify\">I recently attended a competitive 2 day event based around creating an investable business opportunity.

I started Aya because I wanted to offer you the option to choose a purely plantbased alternative to cow\'s butter and other vegetable based oil spreads which is just as tasty and just as versatile - now you can choose a kinder option whenever you like.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Our values and ethics</h2>\r\nAya is far more than plantbased; our values and ethics extend to everything we do.  As a start:\r\n<ul class=\"ayaList\">\r\n<li>We prioritise <span class=\"emphasis\">sustainability</span> which means that we will always consider the impact of our activities on the the environment:</li>\r\n<li>We prioritise <span class=\"emphasis\">transparency</span> which means we believe that you have a right to know exactly what you are buying and how our business operates:</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We will always provide you with information about what our products contain, how they are made and where the ingredients are sourced.</li>\r\n<li>We will always warn you of any health risks associated with our products.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>We prioritise <span class=\"emphasis\">ethical trade</span> and adhere to the Ethical Trade Initiative Basic Code, United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation Core Conventions.</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We will always provide a fair livelihood for all our employees.  We believe that an individual\'s work should offer in return a sustainable and fair livelihood as well as job satisfaction.  We understand that the role of work is only one aspect of an individual\'s life and that happiness can only be achieved in a holistic and balanced way of living.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"blockquote\">The more we grow and make an impact the more we will be able to make demands that align with our highest values but we will need your loyalty to get there.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"justify\">As a start-up we realise the importance of creating a profitable business that aligns with our core values.  We must be profitable so that we can pay our employees, provide a comfortable and conducive working environment and pay our investors a fair return on their investment.  Sometimes we may have to make a small compromise on our values but we will always do so with openness and inform you of our decision.  We will then consistently reassess our decisions in a timely manner.</p> \r\n\r\n<h3>This is what we have implemented so far:</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ayaList\">\r\n<li>We only use <span class=\"emphasis\">non-GMO, organic ingredients</span> because we believe that food should be natural and we do not advocate any chemicals used in the growing, cultivation or processing of our ingredients</li>\r\n<li>We choose <span class=\"emphasis\">no palm-oil</span> because of the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TQQXstNh45g\">catastrophic effects that palm-oil cultivation has had on our rain forests and their inhabitants</a></li>\r\n<li>We will never use plastic, we choose to <span class=\"emphasis\">package our plantbutters in compostable greaseproof paper</span> because this has the lowest environmental impact.  We encourage butter dishes as a way of preserving your butter in the fridge.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>And this is what we intend to implement as soon as we possibly can:</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ayaList\">\r\n<li>We will be a <a href=\"https://bcorporation.net/\">Certified B Corporation</a>.  Certified B Corporations meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability.

We would have been open to integrating with other participants, taking praise and talking about how and what we had done to achieve our success. And how did we act in failure?

I found myself creating illusions about how the other participants perceived me, slipping back into old stories of victimhood. It took me a while to find my strength and inner-worth.

I started Aya because I wanted to offer you the option to choose a purely plantbased alternative to cow\'s butter and other vegetable based oil spreads which is just as tasty and just as versatile - now you can choose a kinder option whenever you like.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"inline-quote\">\r\n<p class=\"blockquote\">The more we grow and make an impact the more we will be able to make demands that align with our highest values but we will need your loyalty to get there.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Our values and ethics</h2>\r\nAya is far more than plantbased; our values and ethics extend to everything we do.  As a start:\r\n<ul class=\"ayaList\">\r\n<li>We prioritise <span class=\"emphasis\">sustainability</span> which means that we will always consider the impact of our activities on the the environment:</li>\r\n<li>We prioritise <span class=\"emphasis\">transparency</span> which means we believe that you have a right to know exactly what you are buying and how our business operates:</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We will always provide you with information about what our products contain, how they are made and where the ingredients are sourced.</li>\r\n<li>We will always warn you of any health risks associated with our products.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>We prioritise <span class=\"emphasis\">ethical trade</span> and adhere to the Ethical Trade Initiative Basic Code, United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation Core Conventions.</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We will always provide a fair livelihood for all our employees.  We believe that an individual\'s work should offer in return a sustainable and fair livelihood as well as job satisfaction.  We understand that the role of work is only one aspect of an individual\'s life and that happiness can only be achieved in a holistic and balanced way of living.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"justify\">As a start-up we realise the importance of creating a profitable business that aligns with our core values.  We must be profitable so that we can pay our employees, provide a comfortable and conducive working environment and pay our investors a fair return on their investment.  Sometimes we may have to make a small compromise on our values but we will always do so with openness and inform you of our decision.  We will then consistently reassess our decisions in a timely manner.</p> \r\n\r\n<h3>This is what we have implemented so far:</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ayaList\">\r\n<li>We only use <span class=\"emphasis\">non-GMO, organic ingredients</span> because we believe that food should be natural and we do not advocate any chemicals used in the growing, cultivation or processing of our ingredients</li>\r\n<li>We choose <span class=\"emphasis\">no palm-oil</span> because of the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TQQXstNh45g\">catastrophic effects that palm-oil cultivation has had on our rain forests and their inhabitants</a></li>\r\n<li>We will never use plastic, we choose to <span class=\"emphasis\">package our plantbutters in compostable greaseproof paper</span> because this has the lowest environmental impact.  We encourage butter dishes as a way of preserving your butter in the fridge.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>And this is what we intend to implement as soon as we possibly can:</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ayaList\">\r\n<li>We will be a <a href=\"https://bcorporation.net/\">Certified B Corporation</a>.  Certified B Corporations meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability. B Corporations are people using business as a force of good.</li>\r\n<li>We will be both <a href=\"https://www.soilassociation.org/\">Soil Association Organic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vegansociety.com/\">The Vegan Society</a> accredited.</li>\r\n<li>We will use <a href=\"https://www.fairtrade.org.uk/\">Fairtrade Foundation</a> ingredients whenever we can.  Fairtrade is about better prices, decent working conditions, local sustainability and fair terms of trade for farmers and workers in the developing world. It requires companies to pay sustainable prices (which must never fall lower than the market price).</li>\r\n</ul>','Our story','','inherit','closed','closed','','297-revision-v1','','','2018-09-20 12:56:36','2018-09-20 12:56:36','',297,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/297-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(709,1,'2018-09-20 13:42:21','2018-09-20 13:42:21','<h1 class=\".d-none .d-sm-block .d-md-none\">Aya Spreadable</h1>\r\n<p class=\"center image-75\">\r\n<img src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/aya-original.png\" alt=\"aya-original\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-631\" />\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Aya Original</h2>\r\n<p class=\"justify\">Aya Original is our first offering.

Aya Original has a <b>total fat content of 71%, of which 42% is saturated fat</b>. Coconut oil and cocoa butter are the main contributors to the saturated fat content. <b>Safflower oil is a healthy fat composed of predominantly poly-unsaturated fat</b>. <span class=\"emphasis\">Aya Original should be consumed responsibly as eating high levels of saturated fat can raise your cholesterol and increase risk of heart disease.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"justify\">Aya Original contains <b>1.5% sunflower lecithin which makes it creamy and spreadable</b>.

It makes sense then that the first thing we need to do is clearly understand the goal and then ensure that our plan of action is directed at achieving this. I realised that I hadn\'t taken the time to understand the point system that the judges were using to evaluate the winner; I was never going to be successful without this knowledge.</p>\r\n<p class=\"center\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-487\" src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/successfailure.jpg\" alt=\"successfailure\" width=\"717\" height=\"388\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"justify\">We all know that failure is inevitable, it is part of life. Some say that failure is the key to success and perhaps that is true but only in so far as you choose to learn from failure. If failure has you feeling so hurt and disheartened that you decide not to expose yourself and give up then it won\'t help you succeed. With this in mind we must choose our goal, aim or purpose carefully. If we are passionate about achieving our goal, aim or purpose because we know that it will bring us lasting fulfilment, satisfaction and happiness then we are more likely to learn from our failures allowing them to further motivate us to try again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"justify\">Perhaps the biggest difference between success and failure is our response to it. I imagined how my team would have responded if we had been successful. We would have glowed with pride and smiled with accomplishment. We would have praised each other on our efforts, quickly forgetting the difficulties that we had faced. We would have been open to integrating with other participants, taking praise and talking about how and what we had done to achieve our success. And how did we act in failure? We were outwardly sympathetic towards our team members. We were introvert, retrospective, critical and analytical. We wanted to to expose the weeds and acknowledge the areas of weakness. We made comparisons about the validity of our idea compared with those that were successful, keen to discover the key to their success.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"blockquote\">We can glow with pride and smile with accomplishment because we gave it a go, because without those that try, those that are willing to expose themselves and make themselves vulnerable, humanity will not progress</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"justify\">When I think about success and failure they are two sides to the same coin. In both scenarios we have a vision, set a goal, make a plan and execute it. It is only the final outcome that is different. I believe that the best thing we can do to alleviate the suffering we create around failure is to respond to failure as we do in success. If we can fail in the knowledge that we will learn from our mistakes, then we can create a new culture where individuals are inspired to try without fear and the stigma of failure. <span class=\"emphasis\">If in failure we can be equally retrospective and analytical about our strengths and our weaknesses, then we can play a better, stronger hand and we can celebrate our strengths despite failure. And just as importantly, if in success we can maintain humility, if we reject feelings of superiority, grandiosity and importance and if we respond just as we do in failure then we narrow the gap between success and failure, and we highlight the significance and importance of the journey rather than the achievement of a goal.</span></p>','The difference between success and failure','','inherit','closed','closed','','463-revision-v1','','','2018-09-20 14:47:52','2018-09-20 14:47:52','',463,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/463-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(712,1,'2018-09-20 14:48:18','2018-09-20 14:48:18','<p class=\"text-right green\">14th October 2016</p>\r\n<p>I have been consuming a vegan and organic diet for the past two years. I made the decision for ethical reasons due to my concerns with the mistreatment of animals in the meat and dairy industry as well as the strain that animal agriculture and chemicals have on the environment.</p>\r\n<p>Initially this was a relaxed decision, however as the years have gone by I am finding it increasingly difficult to eat meat, dairy or non-organic food.</p>\r\n<p>Eating a vegan diet has an interesting learning curve.  One has to meet all their nutritional requirements without meat or dairy sources.  It\'s not impossible but it does take some careful choices and a clear understanding of the nutrients we need and in what foods they are found.  It also requires listening to your body and noticing when things aren\'t quite right.</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve noticed that I depend on  lots of \'exotic\' ingredients that aren\'t sourced locally.  Things like hemp seeds, chia seeds and Spirulina.  In fact most of my protein sources like chickpeas, kidney beans, quinoa and lentils are not sourced locally.  It has me wondering if I am creating a bigger carbon footprint than if I just ate locally sourced ingredients which might include meat and dairy.</p>\r\n<p>The point is that if it were proven that my carbon footprint was larger than if I ate locally sourced foods I would reconsider my choices.  Which brings me back to the aversion I have eating meat, dairy or non-organic food.  Have I become identified with being vegan?  Does it give me satisfaction to say \'I\'m vegan\'?  Do I think I am better than others and judge them because they aren\'t vegan?  Being identified with veganism is of little benefit as it means that I have become closed to new information and defensive about my opinions.</p>\r\n<p>That\'s why I believe that eating consciously is most important.  It\'s not about making judgements or identifications, its about acting for the greatest good.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"inline-quote\">\r\n<p class=\"blockquote\">In every truth the opposite is equally true. That is to say, any truth can only be expressed and put into words when it is one-sided.

Cocoa butter is what gives Aya its melt-in-the-mouth quality, it also helps it stay hard at room temperature.

As a start:\r\n<ul class=\"ayaList\">\r\n<li>We prioritise <span class=\"emphasis\">sustainability</span> which means that we will always consider the impact of our activities on the the environment:</li>\r\n<li>We prioritise <span class=\"emphasis\">transparency</span> which means we believe that you have a right to know exactly what you are buying and how our business operates:</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We will always provide you with information about what our products contain, how they are made and where the ingredients are sourced.</li>\r\n<li>We will always warn you of any health risks associated with our products.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>We prioritise <span class=\"emphasis\">ethical trade</span> and adhere to the Ethical Trade Initiative Basic Code, United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation Core Conventions.</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We will always provide a fair livelihood for all our employees.  We believe that an individual\'s work should offer in return a sustainable and fair livelihood as well as job satisfaction.  We understand that the role of work is only one aspect of an individual\'s life and that happiness can only be achieved in a holistic and balanced way of living.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"justify\">As a start-up we realise the importance of creating a profitable business that aligns with our core values.  We must be profitable so that we can pay our employees, provide a comfortable and conducive working environment and pay our investors a fair return on their investment.  Sometimes we may have to make a small compromise on our values but we will always do so with openness and inform you of our decision.  We will then consistently reassess our decisions in a timely manner.</p> \r\n\r\n<h3>This is what we have implemented so far:</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ayaList\">\r\n<li>We only use <span class=\"emphasis\">non-GMO, organic ingredients</span> because we believe that food should be natural and we do not advocate any chemicals used in the growing, cultivation or processing of our ingredients</li>\r\n<li>We choose <span class=\"emphasis\">no palm-oil</span> because of the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TQQXstNh45g\">catastrophic effects that palm-oil cultivation has had on our rain forests and their inhabitants</a></li>\r\n<li>We will never use plastic, we choose to <span class=\"emphasis\">package our plantbutters in compostable greaseproof paper</span> because this has the lowest environmental impact.  We encourage butter dishes as a way of preserving your butter in the fridge.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>And this is what we intend to implement as soon as we possibly can:</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ayaList\">\r\n<li>We will be a <a href=\"https://bcorporation.net/\">Certified B Corporation</a>.  Certified B Corporations meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability.

We chose the name Aya because we align with her values.</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"text-center\">\r\n<img src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/aya-forest.jpg\" alt=\"aya-forest\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-562\" />\r\n</p>\r\n','Home','','inherit','closed','closed','','287-revision-v1','','','2018-09-20 16:34:56','2018-09-20 16:34:56','',287,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/287-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(732,1,'2018-09-20 16:44:42','2018-09-20 16:44:42','<p class=\"text-right green\">29th November 2017</p>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">I recently attended a competitive 2 day event based around creating an investable business opportunity. I found the whole event quite stressful. My decision to be an active participant meant that from the start I had made myself vulnerable to success or failure. When I was forced to face the rejection of my first pitch it was a very difficult time. I wasn\'t able to stay present, to be in the moment. I found myself creating illusions about how the other participants perceived me, slipping back into old stories of victimhood. It took me a while to find my strength and inner-worth. I kept breathing, pulling myself back to the here and now and thankfully I did recover and focused on helping my team pitch our idea. Unfortunately our idea didn\'t win or come second.</p>\r\n<blockquote class=\"inline-quote\">\r\n<p>We can create a new culture where individuals are inspired to try without fear and the stigma of failure</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">On the way home at the end of the event I started to think about the differences between success and failure. My understanding of success and failure is that it is based on achieving a goal, an aim or a purpose. In competitive scenarios the successor is the one who comes closest to achieving the goal, aim or purpose. It makes sense then that the first thing we need to do is clearly understand the goal and then ensure that our plan of action is directed at achieving this. I realised that I hadn\'t taken the time to understand the point system that the judges were using to evaluate the winner; I was never going to be successful without this knowledge.</p>\r\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-487\" src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/successfailure.jpg\" alt=\"successfailure\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">We all know that failure is inevitable, it is part of life. Some say that failure is the key to success and perhaps that is true but only in so far as you choose to learn from failure. If failure has you feeling so hurt and disheartened that you decide not to expose yourself and give up then it won\'t help you succeed. With this in mind we must choose our goal, aim or purpose carefully. If we are passionate about achieving our goal, aim or purpose because we know that it will bring us lasting fulfilment, satisfaction and happiness then we are more likely to learn from our failures allowing them to further motivate us to try again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"justify\">Perhaps the biggest difference between success and failure is our response to it. I imagined how my team would have responded if we had been successful. We would have glowed with pride and smiled with accomplishment. We would have praised each other on our efforts, quickly forgetting the difficulties that we had faced. We would have been open to integrating with other participants, taking praise and talking about how and what we had done to achieve our success. And how did we act in failure? We were outwardly sympathetic towards our team members. We were introvert, retrospective, critical and analytical. We wanted to to expose the weeds and acknowledge the areas of weakness. We made comparisons about the validity of our idea compared with those that were successful, keen to discover the key to their success.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"inline-quote\">\r\n<p>We can glow with pride and smile with accomplishment because we gave it a go, because without those that try, those that are willing to expose themselves and make themselves vulnerable, humanity will not progress</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">When I think about success and failure they are two sides to the same coin. In both scenarios we have a vision, set a goal, make a plan and execute it. It is only the final outcome that is different. I believe that the best thing we can do to alleviate the suffering we create around failure is to respond to failure as we do in success. If we can fail in the knowledge that we will learn from our mistakes, then we can create a new culture where individuals are inspired to try without fear and the stigma of failure. <span class=\"emphasis\">If in failure we can be equally retrospective and analytical about our strengths and our weaknesses, then we can play a better, stronger hand and we can celebrate our strengths despite failure. And just as importantly, if in success we can maintain humility, if we reject feelings of superiority, grandiosity and importance and if we respond just as we do in failure then we narrow the gap between success and failure, and we highlight the significance and importance of the journey rather than the achievement of a goal.</span></p>','Success is failure turned inside out','','inherit','closed','closed','','463-revision-v1','','','2018-09-20 16:44:42','2018-09-20 16:44:42','',463,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/463-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(733,1,'2018-09-20 16:54:00','2018-09-20 16:54:00','','aya-original','','inherit','open','closed','','aya-original-3','','','2018-09-20 16:54:00','2018-09-20 16:54:00','',607,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/aya-original-1.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(734,1,'2018-09-20 16:54:12','2018-09-20 16:54:12','<h1 class=\"visible-xs-block\">Aya Spreadable</h1>\r\n<p class=\"text-center\">\r\n<img src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/aya-original-1.png\" alt=\"aya-original\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-733\" />\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Aya Original</h2>\r\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Aya Original is our first offering.
