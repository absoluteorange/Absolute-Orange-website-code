With the recent interest in HTML 5 I thought it timely to investigate whether I should be implementing HTML 5 on my website.</p>\n<p>Most XHTML web pages (including BBC, Times Online and Facebook) are effectively not XML on the web because they are being parsed as HTML not XML.  This is because they generally use a MIME content type of \'text/html\' as opposed to \'application/xhtml+xml\'; browsers use MIME type to distinguish between two types of syntax to represent HTML documents namely, HTML serialisation and XML serialisation.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for parsing XHTML pages as HTML and not XML makes sense.  Whilst the DTD\'s for HTML and XHTML are both based on SGML, XHTML is a more restrictive subset of SGML meaning that it has very strict syntax rules.  An XML parser will stop processing an invalid page and nothing except an error message will be displayed.  An HTML parser on the other hand is much more complex and lenient.  It uses an error-correcting tag soup parser to display an invalid page to the best of its ability.</p>\n<p>In reality the interoperability of the Web means that invalid pages are a reality; content feeds, user generated content, body content (CMS), trackbacks, ad services and widgets can all create invalid pages.  By using an HTML parser the page is displayed regardless of its well-formedness.</p>\n<p>The XHMTL 2.0 specification has been in progress since 2001 and is in its eighth public working draft.  It is based solely on XML and is driven by how markup should be used, rather than how markup is currently being used.  It proposes sophisticated and elegant solutions that may also  require a learning curve and it is not backward compatible with XHTML 1.0.</p>\n<p>The proposed XForms, which replaces forms in the XHTML 2.0 specification, was the catalyst for the current HTML 5 specification.  In late 2003 Opera intended to prove that it was possible to extend HTML 4\'s forms to provide many of the introduced features of XForms 1.0 without requiring browsers to implement rendering machines incompatible with existing HTML.  The draft proposal, presented jointly by Mozilla and Opera, was rejected by the W3C on the grounds that it conflicted with the previously chosen direction for the Web\'s evolution.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, Apple, Mozilla and Opera announced their intention to continue working on the effort under the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).  In 2006 the W3C expressed interest in the specification, and created an HTML Working Group to work with the WHATWG on the development of the HTML 5 specification.</p>\n<p>Whilst the HTML 5 specification aims to be backwards compatible with HTML4.0 and XHTML 1.0 this hasn\'t been achieved completely as some elements have new meanings.  The specification focuses on creating a language for web applications as well as the creation of API\'s that improve the client side web development environment.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed API\'s which include a 2D drawing API, a video and audio API, an offline web application API, an API that allows web applications to register themselves for certain protocols or MIME types, an editing API, a drag and drop API, network API\'s and a cross document messaging API will no doubt prove most useful to web developers and is certainly a highlight of HMTL 5 for me.</p>\n<p>Over and above that the HTML 5 specification has overwhelming industry support from browsers, search engines, CMS\'s and authoring tools.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the notion that all documents on the web should be written in an XML format is an ideal one.  Ian Hickson in a conversation about the HTML 5 specification stated that the HTML 5 specification came about because 95% of the Web today is HTML.  He also questioned whether the web would have been successful if it showed error messages whenever something was the least bit wrong.  Ian estimated that 93% of documents on the web have markup errors which would mean that over 90% of the web could not be browsed.</p>\n<p>Neither specification has been implemented in its entirety and the HTML 5 specification looks unlikely to reach its deadline of 2010.  Saying that the &lt;canvas&gt; feature has been widely implemented and with such industry support implementation of some sections may take place sooner.</p>\n<p>Since the XHTML 2.0 specification is not backwards compatible with XHTML 1.0 I am going to embrace the HTML 5 specification until the XHTML 2.0 specification gets implemented.</p>',NULL,NULL,'2009-05-11 00:00:00'),(4,'HTML replacement text','HTML replacement text',NULL,'<p>When deciding how to best insert rich typography into my web pages I implemented 4 technologies namely sIFR, server-side installed fonts, TypeSelect and Cufón which I have reviewed below:</p>\n<h3>sIFR</h3>\n<p>sIFR stands for Scalable Inman Flash Replacement and is an ongoing development on the invention made by Shaun Inman in 2003.   sIFR uses JavaScript and the Document Object Model to replace all designated text with Flash rendered text.</p>\n<h4>Advantages</h4>\n<ol>\n<li> Fairly easy to implement</li>\n<li> Degrades gracefully</li>\n<li> Accessible</li>\n\n<li> Search engine friendly</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Disadvantages</h4>\n<ol>\n<li> Requires a Macromedia Flash plugin</li>\n<li> Requires Macromedia Flash software to create the font file</li>\n<li> Online documentation is extremely fragmented</li>\n<li> Can slow the loading of the web page if used frequently on a web page</li>\n\n<li> Requires  careful tweaking of the CSS font size to get the the desired size</li>\n<li> Overestimates the number of lines required to fit the text which occasionally  leaves the text with a blank line below</li>\n<li> Does not handle hover states as defined in the CSS</li>\n<li> Does not handle customisation of text eg. drop shadows</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Server side fonts</h3>\n<p>Server side fonts require font file(s) to be uploaded to the server.

I wanted the lists to use my own list image.  There are two ways to implement this kind of list; use the CSS background-image option or the CSS list-style-image option.</p>\n<h3 class=\"replacement\">Using CSS background-image</h3>\n\n<p>The CSS background-image option is quite popular as it allows complete control over the positioning of the list images.  However, the problem I had with this option, which can be seen in the first screen grab \'List using background image\', is that the list images do not float correctly against div.media.  The CSS relative:position illustrates that the list images are floated left against the holding div.wrapper.  I could find no way to get the list images to float correctly against div.media.</p>\n<h3 class=\"replacement\">Using CSS list-style-image</h3>\n<p>By using the CSS list-style-image with list-style-position:inside, which one can see in the second screen grab \'List using list-style-image\', this works correctly in Firefox i.e. the list images are floating correctly against div.media.  Unfortunately however, IE does not position the list images optionally as can be seen in the third screen grab \'List using list-style-image in IE\'.  I\'ve checked that my list image is a square with no white space on the left.  I could find not way to position the list images correctly in IE. </p>\n<h3 class=\"replacement\">Using CSS list-style-type for IE</h3>\n<p>The best alternative I could come up with for IE is to resort to list-style-type which correctly positions the list images as can be seen in the fourth screen grab, \'List using list-style-type in IE\'.</p>',NULL,NULL,'2009-07-27 00:00:00'),(6,'Developments in CSS','Developments in CSS',NULL,'<p>During a recent contract I came face to face with &#8216;the CSS nightmare&#8217;.  Huge websites with multiple style sheets using complex specificity to assign styles to elements.  The result was inconsistent styles across various sections of the website, lengthy style sheets and more development hours then was necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Realising there was a problem I needed to find a solution.</p>\n<h3>Object oriented CSS</h3>\n<p>Object oriented CSS works in a similar way to Object Oriented Programming (OOP):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In OOP objects have their own class definitions.  In CSS, selectors (element type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, attribute selectors and pseudo-classes) have their own style declarations</li>\n<li>In OOP classes inherit each others methods and properties.  In CSS inheritance and the cascade determine which style declaration should be applied to any given element.\n<p>Inheritance is the means by which, in the absence of any specific declarations applied by the CSS cascade, a property value of an element is obtained from its parent element.  Inheritance is a mechanism that?s separate from the cascade: inheritance applies to the DOM (Document Object Model) tree.</p>\n<p>The cascade deals with the style sheet rules.  The cascade combines the importance, origin, specificity, and source order of the applicable style declarations to determine exactly?and without conflict?which declaration should be applied to any given element.</li>\n<li>In OOP classes can be public or private.  Objects automatically inherit public classes.  In CSS, properties that are not automatically inherited from the parent can be inherited by specifying a value or &#8216;inherit&#8217; for that CSS property, similar to a private class.  Properties that are inherited automatically are similar to public classes.</li>\n\n</ul>\n<h4>Properties that inherit:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>color</li>\n<li>font (and related properties)</li>\n<li>letter-spacing</li>\n<li>line-height</li>\n<li>list-style (and related properties)</li>\n<li>text-align</li>\n<li>text-indent</li>\n\n<li>text-transform</li>\n<li>visibility</li>\n<li>white-space</li>\n<li>word-spacing</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Properties that don&#8217;t inherit:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>background (and related properties)\n<li>border (and related properties)</li>\n<li>display</li>\n\n<li>float and clear</li>\n<li>height and width</li>\n<li>margin (and related properties)</li>\n<li>min- and max-height and -width</li>\n<li>outline</li>\n<li>overflow</li>\n<li>padding (and related properties)</li>\n<li>position (and related properties)</li>\n<li>text-decoration</li>\n\n<li>vertical-align</li>\n<li>z-index</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The concept of object oriented CSS is noteworthy.  The principles of the reuse of styles and inheritance / cascade are fundamental in creating an optimal CSS.</p>\n<h3>Semantic naming of classes and IDs</h3>\n<p>The semantic naming of classes and IDs is a controversial one.  This concept requires that all classes and IDs be named according to their meaning or role within a web page.  Unfortunately only web developers, designers and author benefit from semantically named classes and IDs.  Web page browsers, screen readers and search engines do not use classes or ID&#8217;s to gain more information about a web page.</p>\n<p>The benefits to web developers, designers and authors are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Semantically named classes and IDs give more meaning to a web page</li>\n\n<li> Semantically named classes and IDs can be stylistically changed in the CSS without having to be renamed in the HTML page</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The disadvantage of semantically naming classes and IDs is that it in some cases there is no  logic in naming it semantically.   Yahoo Grids and Blueprint CSS are both CSS frameworks based on grids and both frameworks name their classes based on their presentation.  For example, Blueprint&#8217;s &lt;div class=?span-24?&gt; relates to a &lt;div&gt; that spans the entire 960px over 24 columns.</p>\n<p>The semantic naming of classes and IDs have their benefits and should be encouraged however, when there is no logical reason to name an element semantically when a name relating to presentation may be more appropriate.  For example, a rounded corner &lt;span&gt; may be named roundedCornerTopLeft.</p>\n\n<h3>How to write your CSS</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Create an element type selectors library<br />Defining the design of all HTML elements during the initial stages of web development ensures that all elements that make up a web page, visually communicate their semantic meaning in relation to each other.  It also sets the basic inheritance properties for elements with no further declarations.</li>\n<li>Define style templates for repeated designs within a web site<br />Defining a style template for repeated designs within a web site ensures that they can be consistently and easily repeated throughout the website.  When defining style templates carefully consider redundancy vs dependency.  Should a style be repeated across different class selectors so that a design change in one does not effect all the others?  Or should they be dependent resulting in a design change affecting all associated elements?   In this case you may also consider using  multiple classes to achieve your design.</li>\n<li>Minimise the use of specific selectors wherever possible and when using them, reference them as specifically as possible.</li>\n<li> Carefully consider the proximity of the cascade</li>\n<li>Always consider progressive enhancement and graceful degradation when styling.  For example if your design has rounded corners use the Mozilla and Webkit rounded corners styles.  However, also consider the best way to implement rounded corners in other browsers as well as a design without rounded corners.</li>\n<li>Remember to check how your page looks with CSS disabled</li>\n\n</ol>',NULL,NULL,'2009-07-01 00:00:00'),(9,'Aria','Aria',NULL,'<p>Two weeks ago I decided to present WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) to my colleagues in our weekly meet.</p>\n<p>Since I had previously read about WAI-ARIA it didn\'t take long for me to understand the theory behind the ARIA specification.  In summary:</p>\n<p>ARIA forms part of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) which succeeds WCAG 1.0 and which are both at working draft level with the W3C. </p>\n<p>It has been developed to address the accessibility problem that occurs when rich interaction semantics are added outside of the markup.  When this happens the markup no longer expresses the information needed to populate accessibility metadata which is then mapped by the browser to the platform accessibility APIs.</p>\n<p>WAI-ARIA provides a framework for providing proper semantics to HTML elements that provide information about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the role of the element within the page and in relation to other elements - the ARIA specification provides an ontology of roles that can be attached to content</li>\n<li>the states and properties of elements which are used to declare important attributes of an element that affect and describe interaction.  These are categorised as widget attributes, live region attributes, drag-and-drop attributes, relationship attributes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The target audience for WAI-ARIA includes user agents, assistive technology, authors who create content, authoring tools and conformance checkers.  The relationship between the user agent, the accessibility API and the assistive technology is best illustrated below:</p>\n<div class=\"media\">\n<img title=\"Relationship between user agents and accessibility api\'s\" src=\"http://www.absoluteorange.com/images/blog/user_agent_accessibility_api_relationship.jpg\">\n</div>\n<p>My next step was to implement WAI-ARIA and test it on my Mac accessibility software, Universal Access.</p>\n<p><strong>27th September 2010 : in the mean time I have learnt that ARIA is only supported by screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, Windows Eyes and SAToGo.</strong></p>\n<p>What makes ARIA difficult to implement is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is only partly supported by browsers and accessibility software making it difficult to know which bits to implement.</li>\n<li>It does not validate on standard DTD\'s</li>\n<li>It only has limited support in HTML5.0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite these hurdles I decided that perhaps before I tried to implement WAI-ARIA I should test some real live examples using the accessibility software on my Mac.</p>\n<p>For obvious reasons, the first website I visited was the RNIB (Royal National Institute of the Blind).   Whilst there are some obvious improvements in accessible navigation including the Web Item Rotor and Web Auto Spots, overall I could find no implementation of ARIA on their website.</p>\n<p style=\"text-decoration:line-through;\">I spent the next few hours trying to find real live examples or demonstrations of WAI-ARIA.  I found a few websites which I have referenced below but to be honest either the examples didn\'t work i.e. they weren\'t supported by Safari or Universal Access, or I didn\'t quite grasp the concepts.</p>\n<p>27th September 2010 : Since ARIA is only supported in JAWS, NVDA, Windows Eyes or SAToGo, I would have to test examples using these assistive technologies.  In the mean time I found <a href=\"http://www.accessibleculture.org\" title=\"Accessible Culture\">Accessible Culture</a> who has taken the time to test various ARIA specifications on all supported screen readers.  This is a very useful website.</p>\n<p style=\"text-decoration:line-through;\">In conclusion, the concept of WAI-ARIA is a good one however, it requires a considerable amount of effort to implement and to date has limited support.  Furthermore at the time of writing there are very few examples of ARIA being implemented.

Furthermore, building a new product has many challenges and unknowns.  Whilst using agile is desirable there are a number of risk factors, which include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Changing core requirements<br />\nAgile works very well in managing changes to feature level requirements as long as the core architecture stays stable.  In new product development requirements that affect the core system or its architecture are common.  Having a clear indication of these requirements during the analysis phase of new product development gives development teams the opportunity to prototype these features without risking other development efforts from being rendered useless as changes occur in core requirements.</li> \n\n<li>Unknown technical challenges that have not been verified with a prototype<br />\nFor a new product, the number of unknown technical challenges (ideas that have not been proven to work) is way bigger than for an established product. It is usually necessary to identify these challenges, understand their impact, plan contingencies and prove the ideas sooner than later. If one of these efforts ends up falling in the later phases of agile development, this could have devastating effects on the overall delivery plans for the product.</li> \n\n<li>Incomplete system architecture<br />\nSystem architecture provides guidance and framework to make sure that the individual pieces of a new product are coming together the right way. Not having complete core architecture is like a bunch of people walking on their own paths with a \'hope\' that they are going to meet somewhere.  Agile methodology has provisions for bringing different parts of the project to sync-up together at the end of each phase. Having a framework to assess where the overall project is going and how it can come together is a key to ensure timely delivery of the entire product (especially when the product is being developed for the first time).</li> \n\n<li>Lack of Framework for Continuous Integration<br />\nAgile methodology requires that there be a way to continuously integrate the features being developed. Not having a framework to integrate, test and verify that the features are working together as intended could seriously hurt the project and may make integration effort a whole lot more challenging than it needs to be. [Agile methodology and new product development: four key issues, 2008.

Browser features are detected using a device description repository (DDR) e.g. WURFL and / or client side JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid a flash of unstyled content when a page loads one cannot leave all the browser feature testing to be run on page load.  Ideally a DDR would be used to determine device features before the page is server to the browser.  However, a DDR costs money and this will really depend on the client requirements.</p>\n\n<p>In my <a href=\"/webApp/gallery\" title=\"responsive prototype\">responsive prototype</a> I use a server session to store the browser\'s features.  This requires that when a device visits my website for the first time all browser features are detected and set in the session.</p>\n\n<p>If no session is set, the server serves the basic version of the web page (the one for the LCD).  The web page determines whether a browser supports HTML5 using the hasTheMustard method.  \n\n<h4>hasTheMustard</h4>\n<p>The hasTheMustard is a method used by the BBC to distinguish between browsers that support HTML5 and those that don\'t.  It tests for browser capabilities using JavaScript namely, Document.querySelector, Window.localStorage and Window.addEventListener.  It should be noted however, that Internet Explorer 8 does not support HTML5 but since it represents such a significant market share we cannot exclude it.  Using JavaScript user agent sniffing we provide an exception for IE8 and upwards.</p>\n\n<p>If a browser does not support HTML5 or does not have JavaScript the basic web page is displayed.  For those that do support HTML5 and have JavaScript the browser returns to the server (via AJAX) browser features including screen width, screen height, orientation, mouse or touch capabilities, local storage, geolocation etc.  This data is set in the server session and used to determine what content, CSS and JavaScript is most appropriate for the device.</p>\n\n<h3>Device groups</h3>\n<p>To differentiate between styles for various devices one sets device groups.  To be truly responsive device group breakpoints should not have any gaps and can be as exhaustive as your resources permit.  The challenge here is to define device groups that can use the same design grid.  In my prototype I have defined the following device groups:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Legacy</h4>\n<p>Screen width less than 240px\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Smart</h4>\n<p>Screen width greater and equal to 240px and less than and equal to 640px.  Within this device group I can have a number of breakpoints including 240px, 320px, 480px and 640px.  I use an 8px grid for this device group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Compact</h4>\n<p>Screen width greater than 640px and less than 960px.  I can have a breakpoint of 640px, 800px and 960px.  I use a 30px grid with 10px gutters for this device group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Large</h4>\n<p>Screen width greater than 960px.  I set a 960px limit on my website size and use a 30px grid with 10px gutters for this device group.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n \n<h3>AMD Loaders</h3>\n<p>To further improve performance AMD (asynchronous module definition) loaders enable JavaScript, CSS, text and il8n:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to load in parallel improving the overall speed of a website page</li>\n<li>to encourage a modular structure of scripts based on dependencies which are easily maintainable</li>\n<li>to follow a well defined and standardised approach in keeping with the prospective ES-Harmony migration path</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Adaptive images</h3>\n<p>A responsive website will serve appropriately sized images to a device that optimises download speeds.  I have chosen to implement a method based on Matt Wilcox\' approach that redirects all image requests to a PHP script.  The PHP script determines the required image dimension and either crops the image at run time or requests it from the cache.</p>\n\n<h3>Interesting insights:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The CSS media query for orientation is currently not widely supported for example, it does not work in iPhone 4 (iOS 4.3.3).  As such my thinking is that the orientation of the device is not required so long as I ensure my stylesheets include styles, using width media queries, for any viewport changes.</li>\n<li>Dynamically removing and adding stylesheets with JavaScript puts considerable strain on the browser as documented by Stubbornella.  For this reason, I use AJAX to determine the appropriate stylesheets to include in my web page.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Technologies I have used</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>RequireJS (AMD Loader and JavaScript and CSS optimiser)</li>\n<li>{Less} (Dyanmic style sheet language)</li>\n<li>UseJS (AMD Loader for non-compatible AMD JavaScripts)</li>\n<li>MasonryJS</li>\n<li>Almond (minimal AMD API implementation for optimised builds)</li>\n<li>Apache Ant (compiler)</li>\n<li>CodeIgniter REST API server</li>\n<li>Backbone JS (JavaScript MVC framework)</li>\n</ul>',NULL,NULL,'2012-05-04 17:00:00'),(38,'absolute_orange_website_redesign','Absolute Orange website redesign',NULL,'<p class=\"wrapper-body\">It had been approximately 4 years since I re-designed the Absolute Orange website and it was time to implement a much needed upgrade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wrapper-body\">The website uses its own CMS which I have cobbled together over the last 6 years.  It is written in Codeigniter PHP and I took 2 weeks to rewrite the code and improve the interface. I was impressed by how much I have improved. The code uses considerably more logic, common libraries and consistent methodologies for CRUD events which translates into fewer lines of code which are easy to understand and manage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wrapper-body\">As with all websites there is an initial planning phase. I spent half a day researching:</p>\n<ul class=\"wrapper-body\">\n<li class=\"touch-list\">Absolute Orange website metrics</li>\n<li  class=\"touch-list\">Top 100 digital agencies websites on various devices</li>\n<li  class=\"touch-list\">Freelance web developer websites on various devices</li>\n<li  class=\"touch-list\">General information on freelancing in the IT industry</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wrapper-body\">This research helped me finalise my website content and from here I defined my information architecture.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wrapper-body\">I decided that as the Absolute Orange website does not have a huge amount of content or interaction I would design it to be responsive (automatically responding to different size devices through the use of adaptive images, the implementation of appropriate grids and specified design elements using CSS media queries).  Following the \'mobile first\' methodology I design and build for a legacy mobile first and once the basic mobile website is built I then optimise for modern mobiles, tablets and desktops ensuring that my breakpoints are set where the design breaks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wrapper-body\">Having defined my overall approach I drew wireframes for both the optimised mobile and tablet devices (see examples below) .  I kept my wireframes idealistic in that I did not allow myself to set any limitations on the design and the user experience.  These would provide a blue print for an ideal product and it would be perfectly acceptable to compromise during development if time or resources so required, but the wireframes represented the desirable solution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wrapper-body\">Now that the essential planning phase was complete I could begin to consider the first stage of development.  I intended to develop a legacy version of the mobile site first.  A legacy version of a website exists to ensure an adequate user experience to the LCD (lowest common denominator).  As such I designed all the pages in Photoshop keeping my designs at 175px width in order to ensure an adequate experience for my LCD (see examples below).</p>\n\n<p>Development could begin.  The legacy version of the website uses little, preferably no JavaScript (in fact I use only 1 script, storing the resolution of the device in a cookie for my adaptive images PHP script) and CSS 1 & 2.  It\'s URI\'s are all searchable and crawlable and once tested and released forms the basis from which to optimise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wrapper-body\">Unfortunately it was at this point that I ran out of time and I needed to release a MVP (minimum viable product).  I decided to optimise the legacy mobile website for phones greater than 240px but less than 640px using CSS media queries and CSS 3 transitions and gradients.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that version 2 will be optimise the existing website for devices greater than 640px, implementing my tablet wireframes as best possible without using JavaScript.  Version 3 will probably be when I begin implementing JavaScript, perhaps looking at implementing a one page JavaScript app for devices less than 640px.</p>',NULL,NULL,'2013-04-29 00:00:00'),(39,'FileAPI','HTML5 File API',NULL,'Demonstrates the file API using drop functionality and uploads the file to the server.

It provides tools that improve the quality and consistency of communication with reporters, and will reduce the time spent on responding to commonly reported issues. This frees our team to spend more time working on improving the security of WordPress.</p>\n<p>The security team has been working on this project for quite some time. Nikolay Bachiyski started the team working on it just over a year ago. We ran it as a private program while we worked out our procedures and processes, and are excited to finally make it public.</p>\n<p>With the announcement of the WordPress HackerOne program we are also introducing bug bounties.

This can range from placing a business information widget in the best location to providing a sample menu with social icon links to a static front page complete with beautiful images. Don’t worry &#8211; nothing new will appear on the live site until you’re ready to save and publish your initial theme setup.</p>\n<div style=\"float: left;width: 48%;margin: 0\">\n<h3>Edit Shortcuts</h3>\n<div style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-4596-2\" width=\"300\" height=\"173\" poster=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/4.7-—-Edit-Shortcuts.jpg\" loop=\"1\" autoplay=\"1\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/edit-shortcuts.mp4?_=2\" /><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/edit-shortcuts.mp4\">https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/edit-shortcuts.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p>Visible icons appear to show you which parts of your site can be customized while live previewing.

Just as JavaScript is a near necessity for smoother user experiences and more modern PHP versions are critical for performance, SSL just makes sense as the next hurdle our users are going to face.</p>\n<p>SSL basically means the link between your browser and the server is encrypted. SSL used to be difficult to implement, and often expensive or slow. Modern browsers, and the incredible success of projects like <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a> have made getting a certificate to secure your site fast, free, and something we think every host should support by default, especially in a post-Snowden era. Google also weighs <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal_6.html\">SSL as a search engine ranking factor</a> and will begin <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/google-will-soon-shame-all-websites-that-are-unencrypted-chrome-https\">flagging unencrypted sites in Chrome</a>.</p>\n<p>First, early in 2017, we will only promote hosting partners that provide a SSL certificate by default in their accounts. Later we will begin to assess which features, such as API authentication, would benefit the most from SSL and make them only enabled when SSL is there.</p>\n<p>Separately, I also think the performance improvements in PHP7 are particularly impressive, and major kudos to everyone who worked on that. We will consider whether hosts use PHP7 by default for new accounts next year as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"4588\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"WordPress 4.7 Release Candidate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordpress-4-7-release-candidate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 04:26:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4579\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:328:\"The release candidate for WordPress 4.7 is now available.

Highlights include a <a href=\"http://2017.wordpress.net/\">new default theme</a>, video headers, custom CSS, customizer edit shortcuts, PDF thumbnail previews, user admin languages, REST API content endpoints, post type templates, and more.</p>\n<p>We’ve made <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk/src?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=39353&amp;stop_rev=39263&amp;limit=200&amp;verbose=on&amp;sfp_email=&amp;sfph_mail=\">quite a few refinements</a> since releasing Beta 4 a week ago, including usability and accessibility enhancements for video headers, media and page template support in starter content, and polishing of how custom CSS can be migrated to and extended by plugins and themes. The REST API endpoints saw a number of bugfixes and notably now have anonymous comment off by default.</p>\n<p>Not sure where to start with testing?

Over the past three years, a thriving ecosystem of more than 6,000 <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages\" target=\"_blank\">packages to extend the editor</a> has grown out of Atom&#8217;s open source community. GitHub estimates Atom now has 2.1 million active users.</p>\n<p>This week Atom added a major missing piece for developers who rely on GitHub as an indispensable part of their workflows. A <a href=\"https://github.atom.io/\" target=\"_blank\">new core package adds Git and GitHub integration</a> to the editor with a dock item and status bar widgets. The first iteration&#8217;s UI gives Atom users the ability to stage changes, create commits, create and switch branches, and resolve merge conflicts. Users can also see pull requests associated with the current branch in the sidebar, as well as a detailed view of issues or pull requests.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/github-package-git.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Atom editor is gaining popularity with WordPress developers. Its package directory lists more than a dozen <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/search?q=WordPress\" target=\"_blank\">packages for WordPress development</a>, including <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/atom-editor-package-adds-autocomplete-for-wordpress-actions-and-filters\" target=\"_blank\">autocomplete for WordPress actions and filters</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-atom-editor-package-offers-code-snippets-for-wordpress-plugin-and-theme-developers\" target=\"_blank\">code snippets for plugin and theme developers</a>.</p>\n<p>GitHub also announced the launch of its new open source GitHub client. <a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub Desktop Beta</a> has been redesigned in <a href=\"https://electron.atom.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Electron</a> to provide a simpler user experience for developers who are new to Git. Building the application on Electron also enables the product&#8217;s development team to move its existing desktop apps to a shared codebase, as outlined on the <a href=\"https://githubengineering.com/how-four-native-developers-wrote-an-electron-app/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub Engineering blog</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>From the start, GitHub Desktop for macOS and Windows were two distinct products, each with their own team. We worked in two separate tech stacks using two different skill sets. To maintain parity across the codebases, we had to implement and design the same features twice. If we ever wanted to add Linux support, we’d have to do it all a third time. All this meant we had twice the work, twice the bugs, and far less time to build new features. As it turns out, building native apps for multiple platforms doesn’t scale.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Rewriting the desktop client on Electron allows GitHub to provide a unified cross-platform experience while reducing development time for the product. The beta app is open source and is <a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">available for download</a> for users who want the newest desktop features before they are officially released.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 May 2017 03:31:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 273 – Mental Health Awareness With Bridget Willard and Ed Finkler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=70259&preview=true&preview_id=70259\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-273-mental-health-awareness-with-bridget-willard-and-ed-finkler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2943:\"<p>The month of May is <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/may\">Mental Health Awareness</a> month.

My first essay for HeroPress was two years ago (&#8220;<a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/w-w-waiting-for-the-right-circumstances/\">W-W-Waiting For The Right Circumstances</a>&#8220;), June 2015; an essay written at a time in which I was at my Zenith.</p>\n<p>It was a story written by a young man full of hope, dreams, and accomplishment. A young man peaking in his career and his relationships. A young man who still had a long way to learn in this world; especially about himself and what true community meant. This essay, the one you are reading now, is from rock bottom.</p>\n<h3>The Great Depression</h3>\n<p>People, mostly those who do not have depression, think of depression as a severe sadness; it is not sadness. Sadness can be felt. Depression is more of a vacuous endurance of life; each moment folding aimlessly into the next. Sadness would be a relief in comparison.</p>\n<p>I have had depression many times in my life prior to the one I am about to tell you about; previously I had managed to endure through it, this time was different and this time I needed help. I, unsurprisingly to me, was diagnosed with (aptly named) &#8216;manic depression&#8217;. This explained my amazing highs, my deepest lows, and the plateau of the in-between.</p>\n<p>What did this mean for me? I didn&#8217;t know, I was still me. Nothing about me had changed other than learning a new label that I had to bare. I was still me. I was still me.</p>\n<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in <a href=\"http://www.who.int/whr/2001/media_centre/press_release/en/\">2001</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;One in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was one in that four people; a large number, yet I felt alone.</p>\n<p>Alone because there is so much stigma attached to having a Mental Wellness issue that we barely talk about it, its almost taboo. We are a society more comfortable with having a broken leg than to tell our bosses, colleagues, friends or peers that we are depressed.</p>\n<p>That needed to change.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Closet</h3>\n<p>At WordCamp Cape Town 2016, I stood in-front of an audience and came out of the figurative closet with my presentation of: &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/11/24/leo-gopal-the-wordpress-community-mental-wellness-and-you/\">The WordPress Community, Mental Wellness, and You</a>&#8221;</p>\n<p>After that talk, many people came out of their own closets to me and thanked me for being so &#8216;brave&#8217; as to talk so openly about a subject so few understood much about. My hope with that talk, with this essay, that an act of openness like this is no longer seen as &#8216;being brave&#8217; but being normal, being understood. It was the &#8216;bravery&#8217; of people like Cory Miller and Rich Robinkoff that allowed me to be brave in telling my own story.</p>\n<p>That was September 2016. In February 2017, I reached my darkest hour when I attempted to take my own life.</p>\n<h3>A New Beginning</h3>\n<p>In many ways, this is my WordPress re-origin story.</p>\n<p>After surviving my own actions, it was the WordPress community that were there to support me. It was my friends I had made in the local WordPress community, and when I opened up about my experience, the international WordPress Community came to help me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are so many people in the WordPress Community who I owe a huge debt to. People who genuinely reached out and cared about the response I gave when asked, &#8216;How are you?&#8217;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was in this moment of realizing I had the WordPress Community that I began to live again; the WordPress community saved my life. It was in this moment that I realized that if I knew I could have this support sooner, I may not have gone as far as I had gone. It was in this moment that I vowed to be blatantly honest with the world so that no one else may ever feel that they are that alone again.</p>\n<p>Is there any other software specific community that can make the claim of being so caring as to have helped someone stay alive? I do not know the answer to that question, but I do know that WordPress and its community has definitely done that for me.</p>\n<h3>WPHugs: Giving back to community</h3>\n<p>I openly wrote about my experiences.</p>\n<p>I even mention it straight up in Job Interviews, and I do believe that this, knowingly or unknowingly, has costed me various positions I could have easily received had there not been any mention of a mental illness and my recent events &#8211; and its understandable.</p>\n<p>How would you react when you ask a candidate about why he left his previous employment, and he answers: &#8220;I am manic depressive, I went a few months off my meds, I did not understand it enough at the time, and then tried to take my own life and later moved cities to be closer to family and friends&#8221;? When all I could have said was I moved cities to be closer to family, with a smile that couldn&#8217;t be argued with.</p>\n<p>I started an initiative called <a href=\"https://wphugs.org/\">WPHugs</a>, a passion project hugely inspired by HeroPress, which is designed to be a safe space in the WordPress Community where topics of Mental Health, and general well-being and life balance can be freely and non-judgmentally spoken about, with care and compassion offered by all. This reminds me, we should have a creed, all great communities have one.</p>\n<p>It is simply fortunate timing that <a href=\"https://wphugs.org/\">WPHugs.org</a> and this essay are launched and written in Mental Health Awareness Month. Some may even go as far as calling it serendipity; a word I have tattooed in Braille on my wrists.</p>\n<p>It is through helping others that I am helping myself, everyday&#8230;</p>\n<h3>In conclusion-ipsum</h3>\n<p>My story is not unique &#8211; it is simply one that is told.</p>\n<p>In speaking out about Mental Wellness and the huge role our community plays in its stigma, I hope that someone, somewhere, also gets &#8216;brave enough&#8217; to speak up and reach out.</p>\n<p>I have no conclusion to this essay&#8230; I continue, everyday, to write it; and I hope you do too.</p>\n<p>The WordPress community doesn&#8217;t just power a percentage of the internet; It empowers too.</p>\n<p>P.S. Talking about it will only become easier by talking about it, so please, continue the conversation; lets more of us talk and keep talking.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Community saved my life: Falling down, lifted up.\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Community%20saved%20my%20life%3A%20Falling%20down%2C%20lifted%20up.&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcommunity-saved-life-falling-lifted%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Community saved my life: Falling down, lifted up.\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcommunity-saved-life-falling-lifted%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcommunity-saved-life-falling-lifted%2F&title=Community+saved+my+life%3A+Falling+down%2C+lifted+up.\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Community saved my life: Falling down, lifted up.\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/community-saved-life-falling-lifted/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/051717-150x150.jpg&description=Community saved my life: Falling down, lifted up.\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Community saved my life: Falling down, lifted up.\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/community-saved-life-falling-lifted/\" title=\"Community saved my life: Falling down, lifted up.\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/community-saved-life-falling-lifted/\">Community saved my life: Falling down, lifted up.</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 May 2017 12:00:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Leo Gopal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"Matt: New TV Ads\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47336\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"https://ma.tt/2017/05/new-tv-ads/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:416:\"<p></p>\n<p>As I mentioned in the <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/12/state-of-the-word-2016/\">State of the Word</a> this is the year we&#8217;re ramping up marketing.

If you manage multiple sites, you may have seen automatic update notices landing in your inbox this evening. The security release is for all previous versions and WordPress is recommending an immediate update. Sites running versions older than 3.7 will require a manual update.</p>\n<p>The vulnerabilities patched in 4.7.5 were responsibly disclosed to the WordPress security team by five different parties credited in the release post. These include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insufficient redirect validation in the HTTP class</li>\n<li>Improper handling of post meta data values in the XML-RPC API</li>\n<li>Lack of capability checks for post meta data in the XML-RPC API</li>\n<li>A Cross Site Request Forgery (CRSF)  vulnerability was discovered in the filesystem credentials dialog</li>\n<li>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered when attempting to upload very large files</li>\n<li>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered related to the Customizer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Several of the vulnerability reports came from security researchers on HackerOne. In a recent <a href=\"https://www.hackerone.com/blog/Q-and-A-with-Wordpress-security-team-lead-aaron-campbell\" target=\"_blank\">interview with HackerOne</a>, WordPress Security Team Lead Aaron Campbell said the team has had a spike in reports since <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-is-now-on-hackerone-launches-bug-bounties\" target=\"_blank\">publicly launching its bug bounty program</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The increase in volume of reports was drastic as expected, but also our team really hadn’t had to process any invalid reports before moving the program public,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;The dynamics of the Hacker Reputation system really came into play for the first time, and it was really interesting to figure out how to best work within it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If WordPress continues to sustain the same volume of reports on its new HackerOne account, users may see more frequent security releases in the future.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.7.5 also includes a handful of maintenance fixes.

Adding video, audio, or images to text widgets typically involves using custom HTML.</p>\n<p>Each of the new widgets in 4.8 takes advantage of the WordPress Media Library. Because the widgets use the media modal, users can insert content from a URL. This is particularly convenient for the Video widget as most videos are not stored locally.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/what-to-expect-in-wordpress-4-8/corevideowidget\"><img width=\"341\" height=\"454\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/CoreVideoWidget.png?fit=341%2C454&ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/what-to-expect-in-wordpress-4-8/coreaudiowidget\"><img width=\"341\" height=\"251\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/CoreAudioWidget.png?fit=341%2C251&ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/what-to-expect-in-wordpress-4-8/coreimagewidget\"><img width=\"341\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/CoreImageWidget.png?fit=341%2C360&ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Core Image Widget\" /></a>\n\n<p>Here is what the core widgets look like on Twenty Seventeen after they&#8217;ve been configured.</p>\n<img />Core Widgets on The Frontend\n<p>The text widget now has a visual editor with a couple of basic formatting tools available. The visual editor supports Keyboard shortcuts. However, it does not support <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds\">oEmbed</a>. Like the post editor, you can switch between Visual and HTML mode. The HTML version of the editor benefits from the upgrade as it provides users with the same formatting tools that are available in the visual editor.</p>\n<img />Text Widget HTML Mode\n<h2>Link Boundaries</h2>\n<p>Link boundaries are <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/89\">a byproduct</a> of the ongoing work to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-editor-team-publishes-ui-prototype-for-gutenberg-an-experimental-block-based-editor\">Gutenberg</a>, WordPress&#8217; new block-based editor. If you&#8217;ve ever written links in the visual editor, you may have noticed that sometimes it&#8217;s difficult to move the cursor outside of the link element.</p>\n<p>In WordPress 4.8, link boundaries provide a visual cue of when the cursor is inside a link element. <a href=\"https://cloudup.com/c49BKKIE7SW\">This video</a> recorded by Matias Ventura provides a visual demonstration of how link boundaries work.</p>\n<img />Inside Link Boundary\n<img />Outside Link Boundary\n<p>During testing it felt like this was more of a bug fix to how the visual editor behaves rather than a new feature.</p>\n<h2>Dashboard News Widget Includes Upcoming Local WordPress Meetups</h2>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/topics/wordpress/\">1,180 WordPress meetups</a> registered on Meetup.com and <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/\">close to 100 WordCamps</a> scheduled for this year. In an effort to remind users of the WordPress communities that exist around them world-wide, the WordPress News Dashboard widget has been modified to include Meetups and WordCamps near a user&#8217;s location.</p>\n<img />News Widget Shows Upcoming Meetups and WordCamps\n<p>The widget will try to guess your location automatically. If it&#8217;s incorrect, clicking the Pencil button opens a box where you can type in your city. The bottom of the widget includes links to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups-landing-page\">WordPress Meetup landing page</a>, <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">WordCamp Central Schedule</a>, and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/\">WordPress.org news blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8 Sets the Stage for Gutenberg</h2>\n<p>It should be noted that WordPress 4.8 will not include Gutenberg. It does, however, lay the foundation for Gutenberg to arrive in a future release.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to install and test WordPress 4.8 Beta 1 is to install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">Beta Tester plugin</a> on a staging site. Once activated, visit Tools &gt; Beta Testing and select Point release nightlies and then update WordPress.</p>\n<p>If you believe you&#8217;ve encountered a bug, you can report it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta section</a> of the WordPress support forums. Please provide as much detail about the bug as possible. WordPress 4.8 is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/4-8/\">tentatively scheduled</a> for release June 8th.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 May 2017 23:26:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"WPTavern: Hookr Plugin Rebrands as WP Inspect, Project to Shift to a Module-Based Architecture\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=70093\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wptavern.com/hookr-plugin-rebrands-as-wp-inspect-project-to-shift-to-a-module-based-architecture\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3162:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wp-inspect.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>A year and a half after the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-free-hookr-plugin-displays-all-available-hooks-inside-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">initial release</a> of the controversially-named Hookr plugin, its creator, Christopher Sanford, has rebranded the plugin as WP Inspect. The plugin provides a WordPress hook/API reference for developers and displays the actions and filters that fired as the page loaded. At launch Sanford was fairly committed to the Hookr brand, despite criticism, due to an oversaturated market for WordPress developer plugins. After 3,500 downloads, Sanford decided to rebrand and put the plugin in the official directory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Based on the usage and positive feedback, I wanted to target a broader audience, which led to both the re-brand and submission to the WordPress Plugin repository,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;Leveraging the plugin repo, it will be much easier to coordinate/communicate updates, which is somewhat lacking today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The 1.0.0 release of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-inspect/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Inspect</a> includes mostly bug fixes and technical debt cleanup with two major enhancements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WP Inspect will only be active under specific roles, with Administrators being enabled by default. (Previously it was active for everyone.)</li>\n<li>Action detail now requires no additional clicks. (Before, if users wanted to inspect an action, they would have to click the action name.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sanford said WP Inspect will be migrating to a module-based architecture that will allow users to create their own tooling. He is also planning to release several commercial modules that will expand the debugging capabilities of the plugin. He said he doesn&#8217;t anticipate the type of demand or usage that would warrant a marketplace for third-party modules, but he&#8217;s open to the idea.</p>\n<p>With the plugin now rebranded and released, Sandford is using his time to create the infrastructure to offer Hookr as a SaaS product for commercial theme and plugin developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Depending on membership level, users can interface with HookrAPI to get additional details for debugging,&#8221; Sandford said. &#8220;Users may submit their current codebase for &#8216;comment coverage&#8217; analysis, which is great for determining the quantity and quality of inline code documentation. Finally, users may submit their projects to HookrAPI for real time code parsing and documentation to be included with their commercial theme or plugin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hookr-api-e1494965787732.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Sanford plans to launch a sister site to the online <a href=\"http://hookr.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Hookr.io</a> reference, under another &#8220;G-rated&#8221; name with a simplified interface, as well as an offline version of Hookr.

The plaintiff, <a href=\"http://artifex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Artifex Software Inc.</a>, is the creator of <a href=\"http://artifex.com/products-ghostscript-overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Ghostscript</a>, an AGPL-licensed PDF interpreter. In 2016, the company filed a lawsuit against <a href=\"http://hancom.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hancom</a>, a South Korean software company that incorporated Ghostscript into its Hangul word processing software without complying with the GPL.</p>\n<p>Ghostscript is available for free for those who use it in compliance with its AGPL license. Artifex also offers a <a href=\"http://artifex.com/licensing/\" target=\"_blank\">commercial license of Ghostscript</a> that is required if the user is including it and distributing it within an application that is not licensed under the AGPL. Richard Stallman outlined this common practice of <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/selling-exceptions\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;selling exceptions&#8221; to the GPL</a> in 2010, saying that he has considered it acceptable since the 1990&#8217;s, because &#8220;this approach has made it possible for important programs to become free software.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:2016cv06982/305835/32\" target=\"_blank\">complaint</a>, Hancom failed to purchase a commercial license and also did not distribute the source code as required by the AGPL:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Because Defendant did not have a commercial license for Ghostscript, its use and distribution of Ghostscript constituted consent to the terms of the GNU GPL&#8230;In addition, Defendant’s website stated that it had licensed Ghostscript under the GNU GPL. Nonetheless, Defendant failed to comply with key provisions of the GNU GPL. In particular, because Defendant integrated Ghostscript into its software without revealing to the end-user that Ghostscript was part of the Hancom software, the GNU GPL required Defendant to distribute its software with the accompanying source code. Defendant did not do so and thus violated the GNU GPL, terminating Defendant’s license to use Ghostscript. Defendant’s failure to obtain a commercial license deprived Plaintiff of a licensing fee, or, alternatively, its failure to comply with the GNU GPL deprived Plaintiff of the opportunity “to further promote the advancement of interpreter technologies.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although Hancom is said to have removed Ghostscript from its software in August 2016, Artifex is asking for a court order for Hancom to stop the infringement and seeks compensation for damages. Artifex also requests that the court require Hancom to distribute to each licensee of Hangul and Hancom Office the complete source code for the products in accordance with the GPL.</p>\n<p>Hancom responded by filing a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that Artifex had not demonstrated the existence of a contract, how it was breached, or the damages caused by a breach.</p>\n<p>An order issued by Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ruled that Artifex has sufficiently established the existence of a contract:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The GNU GPL, which is attached to the complaint, provides that the Ghostscript user agrees to its terms if the user does not obtain a commercial license. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant used Ghostscript, did not obtain a commercial license, and represented publicly that its use of Ghostscript was licensed under the GNL GPU. These allegations sufficiently plead the existence of a contract.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, the ruling also recognized the damage that results from a company failing to comply with an open source license, citing the 2008 ruling on Jacobsen v. Katzer, another open source licensing dispute:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Indeed, as the Federal Circuit has recognized, there is harm which flows from a party’s failure to comply with open source licensing: “[t]he lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration” because “[t]here are substantial benefits, including economic benefits, to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties.” Jacobsen v. Katzer, 535 F.3d 1373, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although QZ.com and other media outlets are reporting that this is a groundbreaking ruling that <a href=\"https://qz.com/981029/a-federal-court-has-ruled-that-an-open-source-license-is-an-enforceable-contract/\" target=\"_blank\">makes open source licenses an enforceable contract</a>, the case has not yet gone to trial. The court has simply denied Hancom&#8217;s arguments that because the company didn&#8217;t sign anything, the GPL does not constitute a contract. The ruling states that Artifex&#8217;s allegations regarding the dual licensing structure for its product are enough for the company to begin the process of pleading damages for its claim that Hancom breached its contract. It is not a ruling about whether or not copyleft licenses are enforceable.</p>\n<p>Artifex is now free to pursue its case of breach of contract and copyright infringement claims against Hancom, but it&#8217;s still very early and may end in a settlement. Hancom is ordered to file its answer by May 18 and both parties are scheduled to appear for an Initial Case Management Conference on June 15.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 May 2017 19:09:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:115:\"WPTavern: WordPress.com Experiments With Allowing Business Plan Customers to Install Third-Party Plugins and Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=70129\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:126:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-experiments-with-allowing-business-plan-customers-to-install-third-party-plugins-and-themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2521:\"<p>One of the most important things that distinguishes self-hosted WordPress from WordPress.com is the ability to install custom themes and plugins.

Having the profile public makes it possible for the team to work together on triaging the issues that are submitted. WordPress Security Czar Aaron Campbell said the new system will reduce the time spent on responding to commonly reported issues, allowing the team to spend its time more effectively.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have about 40 people with access to triage reports, although, like most volunteer groups, not everyone is usually triaging at the same time,&#8221; Campbell said.</p>\n<p>The project also launched bug bounties to reward reporters for responsibly disclosing security issues and Campbell said the team has awarded more than $3,700 in bounties to seven different reporters.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So far bounties have ranged from $150 to $1,337,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;Anything that qualifies for a cash bounty will be $150+. We have a few swag bounties (hoodies) for really small things that will be going out soon as well (finishing getting everything set up with the swag store to do this now).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Campbell confirmed that $1,337 is not the upper limit of the bounties and that there are bugs that could qualify for larger bounties.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Bounties are calculated based on bug severity, the product or site it&#8217;s on (WordPress core being weighted more heavily than say the swag store), and also the quality of the report,&#8221; Campbell said. <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic</a> is sponsoring the bounty payouts on behalf of the WordPress project.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 15 May 2017 19:51:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"BuddyPress: Naturkontakt, Organising Sweden’s Largest Environmental NGO\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=265947\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://buddypress.org/2017/05/naturkontakt-organising-swedens-largest-environmental-ngo/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9271:\"<div><em>This is a guest post by Alexander Berthelsen (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lakrisgubben\">lakrisgubben</a>) from the Swedish WordPress agency <a href=\"https://www.klandestino.se/\">Klandestino AB</a></em>.</div>\n<p>Peer reviewed by <a class=\"bp-suggestions-mention\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/boonebgorges/\" rel=\"nofollow\">@boonebgorges</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/front-page.png\" alt=\"Naturkontakt front page\" width=\"1675\" height=\"919\" class=\"size-full wp-image-265953\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturkontakt.naturskyddsforeningen.se/\">Naturkontakt</span></a> (Nature contact) is the home for members of the <a href=\"http://www.naturskyddsforeningen.se/in-english\">Swedish Society for Nature Conservation</a> (SSNC), Sweden’s largest environmental NGO with over 200,000 members. This is a private site where SSNC members can read and publish internal news about the organisation, take part in forum discussions, and join or create groups to help them organise their work. Members of SSNC can create WordPress user accounts using their membership numbers from the organization&#8217;s CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Naturkontakt has been around since the 90’s, powered by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FirstClass\">FirstClass</a>. By 2010, that platform had become outdated and its market share was declining. This led some members to write proposals to find a new platform. Their goal was to select a platform which would serve as a hub for all the different aspects of SSNC’s mission and vision. These include &#8220;spreading knowledge, charting environmental threats, proposing solutions, and influencing politicians and authorities, both nationally and internationally. Under democratic forms, we work regionally in 24 county branches and locally in 270 community branches.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Moving to WordPress</h2>\n<p>In 2011, SSNC acted on their decision to set up a new web-based platform for internal communications and contacted us at <a href=\"https://www.klandestino.se/\">Klandestino</a> to work on this project. After evaluating different platforms, we chose WordPress. Some deciding factors include WordPress&#8217; open source licensing, our experience working with the platform, and the plethora of different plugins that extended WordPress to make it suitable for online communities.</p>\n<p>The first iteration of the new Naturkontakt site was launched in 2011, powered by WordPress and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-symposium-pro/\">WP Symposium</a>. This was quite a while ago but as I recall (plus email logs), the choice stood between BuddyPress and WP Symposium. At that time, WP Symposium already had a forums component while BuddyPress lacked a solid forum integration. Remember that this was the time of the stand-alone bbPress forums which took a tortuous and unstable route to integrate to both WordPress and BuddyPress.</p>\n<h2>bbPress 2.0 to the Rescue</h2>\n<p>A year after we launched the new site, we undertook an evaluation which revealed some pain points. To name a few, WP Symposium had limited extensibility, some security issues, and major problems with performance. With those challenges in mind, we researched again into other community solutions for WordPress. By that time, the <a href=\"https://bbpress.org/blog/2011/09/bbpress-2-0-now-available/\">new bbPress 2.0 plugin was available</a> and it worked very well with BuddyPress.</p>\n<p>It was an easy decision to switch from WP Symposium to BuddyPress and bbPress. The major tasks were the arduous migration of data and continuous testing. This new set up has stood the test of time, we&#8217;re really pleased with it. The BuddyPress-bbPress combination gave us a running start with forums, groups, profiles, and messages, which are some of the required pieces of functionality needed on Naturkontakt.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/profile-forums-page.png\" alt=\"Profile page\" width=\"1668\" height=\"785\" class=\"size-full wp-image-265954\" /></p>\n<p>Further development of Naturkontakt 2.0 led to the introduction of multisite features to the community. Fortunately, BuddyPress works very well in a multisite environment. Each local organisation (group) of SSNC could have their own subsite to publish news.</p>\n<p>To make this work as smoothly as possible, we wrote custom plugins for the following functionalities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many-to-many relationships between groups and subsites. For example, the group coordinating work on forest issues could be connected to the subsite publishing news about forest issues.</li>\n<li>File archives for groups so that members can upload and version docs, PDFs, images, etc.</li>\n<li>Sitewide search, a plugin that indexes all content from the entire multisite network into a “ghost” site to make it possible to have a centralised search throughout the entire network and blog/archive pages that lists posts from all sites.</li>\n<li>A drag and drop front page workflow where the editors of the site can search for and list articles from all sites on the network on the main site front page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This second version of Naturkontakt was released in late 2012. Since then, the basic functionalities have remained more or less the same. The site did get a facelift a few years ago when we focused on making the site work better on phones and tablets.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/blog-archive.png\" alt=\"Blog Archive\" width=\"1677\" height=\"920\" class=\"size-full wp-image-265955\" /></p>\n<h2>Going forward with PHP 7</h2>\n<p>Last year, after a month of capacity/speed problems, a new evaluation showed that some long-delayed upgrades had to be made. We started a new project to focus mainly on stability and speed improvements. We finished the project just right before this article was written.</p>\n<p>We implemented the following improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Combed through the codebases</strong>. We searched for deprecated functions and places where custom functionality could be replaced with newly added functionality from BuddyPress, WordPress, and bbPress. We decreased the number of active plugins by a third because of the new features that had been rolled into the above-mentioned projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Switched over to<a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/\"> Elasticsearch</a>/<a href=\"https://www.elasticpress.io/\">ElasticPress</a></strong>. Our custom sitewide search has served its purpose well. However, since it’s only been used on this platform its development has fallen behind. And compared to new technologies such as Elasticsearch it didn’t cut the mustard. By switching to Elasticsearch we have offloaded a lot of the most expensive queries currently done by WordPress to a server/platform that’s fine-tuned for that kind of work.</li>\n<li><strong>Upgraded to PHP 7</strong>. This was the last part of the project. We’ve seen major improvements in the response time from the server, on average about 50%-70% decrease in response times! That is, of course, very important on a dynamic site such as for any community where static page caching often isn’t an option.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\n<p>Our stats show the continued growth of the SSNC community, even though the competition from Facebook can be really hard. One of the major advantages of using WordPress, BuddyPress, and bbPress is that SSNC owns its own data.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are always things to improve on. When we completed the recent project to improve performance, despite limited budgets and time constraints, we were all satisfied and hopeful that the site will be around for many more years. We also expect that upcoming development work will be focused more on the user interaction elements of the site, hopefully by building upon and extending the great work that has gone into <a href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/next-template-packs\">BP Nouveau.</a> &lt;3</p>\n<p>To end on a personal note I’d like to thank all of the wonderful contributors to BuddyPress who have welcomed me into the community and helped me along with trac tickets and patches. Beyond my satisfaction with Naturkontakt and working with SSNC (whom I share a lot of political views with), and the functionality that BuddyPress has provided for the project, the best part of having worked on this site is that I also feel that I’ve become part of a community that tries to do something constructive about the unpleasant grip that Facebook has over our personal and professional lives.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/lakrisgubben.jpeg\" alt=\"lakrisgubben\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-265950\" /> <em><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lakrisgubben\">Alexander Berthelsen</a> and his two colleagues are co-owners of the web development co-operative <a href=\"http://klandestino.se/\">Klandestino AB</a>.

planning a smaller WP release early next month, bringing in three major enhancements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An improved visual editor experience, with a new TinyMCE that allows you to navigate more intuitively in and out of inline elements like links. (Try it out to see, it&#8217;s hard to describe.)</li>\n<li>A revamp of the dashboard news widget to bring in nearby and upcoming events including meetups and WordCamps.</li>\n<li>Several new media widgets covering images, audio, and video, and an enhancement to the text widget to support visual editing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first beta of 4.8 is now available for testing. You can use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">beta tester plugin</a> (or just run trunk) to try the latest and greatest, and each of these areas could use a ton of testing. Our goals are to make editing posts with links more intuitive, make widgets easier for new users and more convenient for existing ones, and get many more people aware of and attending our community events.</p>\n<p><em>Four point eight is here<br />\nSmall changes with a big punch<br />\nBig ones come later</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 13 May 2017 00:15:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Matt Mullenweg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 272 – Interview With James Farmer, Co-Founder and CEO of Incsub\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=70009&preview=true&preview_id=70009\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-272-interview-with-james-farmer-co-founder-and-ceo-of-incsub\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4563:\"<p>On this episode of WordPress Weekly, I&#8217;m joined by <a href=\"https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/author/james/\">James Farmer</a>, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://incsub.com/\">Incsub</a>. Farmer has been involved in the WordPress community for 11 years and in that time, he and I have butted heads, mildly speaking.</p>\n<p>Last year, Farmer <a href=\"https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/10-years-as-a-wordpress-entrepreneur/\">looked back</a> at the last 10 years of being a WordPress entrepreneur. In that post, he shares emails and conversations he has had in the WordPress community that are cringe-worthy. Because of the extremely poor interactions I&#8217;ve had with Farmer in the past, I&#8217;ve kept away from his work and the projects he is associated with.</p>\n<p>In the past few months, I&#8217;ve read interviews with Farmer where he appears to have turned over a new leaf. In an <a href=\"https://torquemag.io/2017/04/qa-wpmu-dev-ceo-james-farmer/\">interview on Torquemag</a> congratulating him on WPMU Dev&#8217;s Smush Image Compression plugin <a href=\"http://torquemag.io/2017/04/wp-smush-defeats-wordfence-wins-plugin-madness-2017/\">winning the Plugin Madness competition</a>, Farmer is asked what advice he would give to aspiring plugin developers?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Make the free version as brilliant as you possibly can. Give back to the community as much as you can and it’ll come back to you in spades,&#8221; Farmer said. &#8220;Contribute to the wordpress.org support forums and community, commit code if you can, speak at WordCamps, and be as helpful and useful as possible, it’ll ALL be worth it, I promise.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked what&#8217;s the most important lesson he&#8217;s learned as CEO and co-founder of WPMU Dev, he responded:</p>\n<blockquote><p>That is a very good question, and one I think I’m actually probably not able to answer as there are basically so so many important things.</p>\n<p>I think though if I had to pick one, it goes along the same lines as my last answer: the more you give out, the more you give of yourself and the more, kinda, selfless that you are… the more you get back. And, sadly (and from painful experience), the opposite is also true.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Because of the way he answered these questions and my curiosity for his career in WordPress, I invited him on WordPress Weekly. We talked about his entrepreneurial career and some of the failures along the way. He explains the genesis behind the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/\">Smush Image Optimization Plugin</a> and shares what it&#8217;s like to be part of the WordPress community in Australia.</p>\n<p>My favorite part of the interview is when Farmer describes his experience at WordCamp Europe a few years ago that fundamentally changed his perception of the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>After this interview, I can confidently say that the past between us is water under the bridge. I look forward to future conversations with Farmer and taking a closer look at his company&#8217;s products.</p>\n<h2>Stories Discussed:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/bbpress-2-6-beta-3-likely-as-team-focuses-on-solid-data-migration-path\">bbPress 2.6 Beta 3 Likely as Team Focuses on Solid Data Migration Path</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/versionpress-4-0-tentatively-scheduled-to-ship-in-september\">VersionPress 4.0 Tentatively Scheduled to Ship in September</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-release-targeted-for-june-8\">WordPress 4.8 Release Targeted for June 8</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wphugs-a-community-devoted-to-educating-discussing-and-raising-awareness-of-mental-health\">WPHugs: A Community Devoted to Educating, Discussing, and Raising Awareness of Mental Health</a></p>\n<h2>WPWeekly Meta:</h2>\n<p><strong>Next Episode:</strong> Wednesday, May 17th 3:00 P.M.

This version added new search capabilities, bulk undo, and a number of bug fixes. It was the first release since it became a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/versionpress-transitions-into-a-free-open-source-project\">free, open source project</a>.</p>\n<p>In a post on the <a href=\"https://blog.versionpress.net/2017/05/versionpress-4-0-update/\">project&#8217;s development blog</a>, Borek Bernard, co-founder of VersionPress, describes what the team is focusing on for 4.0 which includes a tentative release schedule.</p>\n<p>VersionPress 4.0 beta is planned to ship in June with 4.0-final scheduled to ship in September. In addition, the team will be labeling the project as a Developer Preview to better indicate its production-readiness.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With every major release, you rightfully ask about the status of the project when it comes to production-readiness,&#8221; Bernard said. &#8220;The answer is &#8216;your mileage may vary&#8217; but we feel we should better indicate that it’s only really intended for developers, currently. Therefore, we’ll be adding the ‘Developer Preview’ label for the project as a whole.&#8221;</p>\n<p>VersionPress 4.0 beta 1 will support Jetpack and WooCommerce via <a href=\"https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/blob/master/docs/Plugin-Support.md\">plugin definitions</a>. Updates to internal data structures, compatibility fixes with WordPress 4.7, and other improvements are also slated to be in 4.0.</p>\n<p>Bernard also provides an outline of what to expect from the project in the near future. The team hopes to release Version 5.0 later this year or early next year with definitions for the most popular plugins. It will also be the first version rolled out on the project&#8217;s upcoming platform. Version 6.0 is expected a year after that.</p>\n<p>To contribute to VersionPress, you can get in touch with the founders through <a href=\"https://gitter.im/versionpress/versionpress\">Gitter</a> or visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/projects/2\">project&#8217;s Github page</a> where pull requests are welcomed.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 May 2017 00:34:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"Akismet: Akismet WordPress Plugin 3.3.2 Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2017/05/10/akismet-wordpress-plugin-3-3-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:869:\"<p>Version 3.3.2 of <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> is now available.

Since the beginning, I have been close to Udaipur. With the studies and growing up here, the thought of leaving this beautiful city have never occurred to me. Everything I have achieved in life could never have been possible without the support of my parents.</p>\n<p>The 6 months after the graduation have been the most troublesome. At the time it felt as if finding a job was a big challenge, but I never gave up. There is a saying that “No work is big or small. It’s not the stature of work that matters, but what you learn from working that counts” and that is when I started to look for a job out of my field of expertise. My life had a new turn and me, fortunately, got a job at KPO and that was a new beginning of my life.</p>\n<h3>How I got into WordPress</h3>\n<p>Before joining into IdeaBox I don&#8217;t know much about WordPress. Before knowing about WordPress my identity was just a beginner. By keep working on WordPress I got so much involvement in that. WordPress gave me a chance in my life to prove that I could do something different and I felt like I have the skills and potential and I could do something. I got my confidence back. I always try to learn something new in WordPress.</p>\n<p>I do theme development in WordPress. I have learned so much from WordPress. I can proudly say I am the part of WordPress community. One thing I got a chance to learn is in life, there is no shortcut for success. Whatever person get in life is only because of the hard work.</p>\n<p>I have completed 3 years in WordPress and I love to be a part of it. I love WordPress and it has the wonderful community. In my free time, I do WordPress translations. I try to contribute in every possible way by giving support, translating and any other things.</p>\n<h3>First Speaking Experience at WordCamp</h3>\n<p>WordCamp Udaipur got organized recently. In that, I was the organizer and speaker. It was the amazing experience which I never felt before. After WordCamp only I get to know that how big community it is. When I become the speaker of the WordPress is the most memorable and the greatest experience of my life. I will never forget this moment in my life.</p>\n<p>One thing is I was part of the organizing team and my first session. I was totally nervous. The session went so well and all nervousness went away in happiness. Because I realized that talking in front of these many people is not an easy task. So, I was very Happy. If I get a chance to perform In WordPress community, I will do my contribution in any way.</p>\n<h3>Thank you note</h3>\n<p>Thanks to WordPress for changing my life and I want to especially thank my parents for supporting and believe me always.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1 id=\"hindi\">सफलता का कोई शॉर्टकट नहीं है</h1>\n<p>उदयपुर को झीलों के शहर के रूप में भी जाना जाता है, यह राजस्थान के खूबसूरत शहर में से एक है और यही वह जगह है जहाँ से मैं हूं। शुरुआत से ही मैं उदयपुर में रहने और पढ़ाई के साथ और यहां पले बड़े होने की वजह से इस खूबसूरत शहर को छोड़ने का विचार मुझे कभी नहीं आया। जीवन में जो कुछ भी हासिल किया है, वह मेरे माता-पिता के समर्थन के बिना कभी संभव नहीं हो सकता था।</p>\n<p>पढ़ाई पूरी होने के ६ महीने बाद तक सबसे ज्यादा परेशानी रही। समय के साथ ऐसा महसूस हुआ जैसे काम ढूंढना काम करने से ज्यादा कठिन था, लेकिन मैंने अपना मनोबल टूटने नहीं दिया और धैर्य से काम लिया। जैसा कि कहा जाता है &#8220;कोई काम बड़ा या छोटा नहीं है, किसी काम को करने से जो आप सीखते है वह मायने रखता है&#8221; और तब मैंने अपने विशेषज्ञता के क्षेत्र से हटकर नौकरी खोजना शुरू कर दिया। मेरी जिंदगी का एक नया मोड़ था और मुझे सौभाग्य से केपीओ में नौकरी मिली और यही वह जगह थी जहां मेरे जीवन की एक नई शुरुआत शुरू हुई।</p>\n<h3>कैसे मैंने WordPress को जाना</h3>\n<p>आइडियाबॉक्स में शामिल होने से पहले मुझे वर्डप्रेस के बारे में अधिक जानकारी नहीं थी। वर्डप्रेस के बारे में जानने से पहले मेरी पहचान सिर्फ एक प्रवर्तक के रूप में थी। वर्डप्रेस पर काम करते रहने से, मेरी इसमें सहभागिता बढ़ती गयी। वर्डप्रेस ने मुझे अपने जीवन में एक मौका दिया है ताकि साबित हो कि मैं कुछ अलग कर सकती हूं और मुझे लगा कि मेरे पास कौशल और क्षमता है और मैं कुछ कर सकती हूं। मुझे अपना आत्मविश्वास वापस मिल गया। मैं हमेशा वर्डप्रेस में कुछ नया सीखने की कोशिश करती हूं।</p>\n<p>मैं वर्डप्रेस में थीम डेवलपमेंट करती हूं। मैंने वर्डप्रेस में बहुत कुछ सीखा है। मैं गर्व से कह सकता हूं कि मैं वर्डप्रेस समुदाय का हिस्सा हूं। एक बात मुझे जीवन में जानने को मिली है कि सफलता के लिए कोई शॉर्टकट नहीं है। जो कुछ भी जीवन में मिलता है, कड़ी मेहनत के कारण ही मिलता है।</p>\n<p>मैंने वर्डप्रेस में 3 साल पूरे किए हैं और मैं इसका हिस्सा बनकर बेहद खुश हूं। मुझे वर्डप्रेस पसंद है और इसमें अद्भुत समुदाय है मेरे खाली समय में मैं वर्डप्रेस अनुवाद करती हूं। मैं वर्डप्रेस में समर्थन, अनुवाद और अन्य चीजें देने के हर संभव तरीके से योगदान करने की कोशिश करती हूं।</p>\n<h3>WordCamp में पहली बार वक्ता बनने का अनुभव</h3>\n<p>Wordcamp उदयपुर हाल ही में आयोजित किया गया। उसमें मैं आयोजक और स्पीकर थी यह अद्भुत अनुभव था जिसे मैंने पहले कभी महसूस नहीं किया था। वर्डकैंप में मुझे पता है कि यह कितना बड़ा समुदाय है। यह मेरे जीवन का सबसे यादगार और सबसे बड़ा अनुभव है। मैं इसे एक क्षण के लिए भी नहीं भूलूंगी।</p>\n<p>एक बात यह है कि मैं आयोजक टीम का हिस्सा थी और मेरा पहला सेशन। मैं पूरी तरह नर्वस थी। सेशन बहुत अच्छा गया और सभी घबराहट खुशी में बदल गई। क्योंकि मुझे एहसास हुआ कि इतने लोगों के सामने बात करना आसान बात नहीं थी। इसलिए मैं बहुत खुश थी। यदि मुझे वर्डप्रेस समुदाय में प्रदर्शन करने का मौका मिलता है तो मैं किसी भी तरह से योगदान करुँगी।</p>\n<h3>धन्यवाद पत्र</h3>\n<p>वर्डप्रेस के लिए धन्यवाद जिसने मुझे खुद को साबित करने का मौका दिया और मैं अपने माता-पिता के लिए विशेष रूप से धन्यवाद करना चाहती हूं कि उन्होंने हमेशा मुझ पर विश्वास किया और मुझे प्रोत्साहित किया।</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: There is No Shortcut to Success &#8211;

he said. &#8220;It kind of goes back to the old bbPress problem where WordPress.org is running 2.5 and is also running a hybrid of 2.6 to take advantage of performance improvements.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Throughout the process of migrating WordPress.org from bbPress 2.5 to 2.6, the development team was able to resolve a number of bottlenecks associated with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/mattnote-from-wordcamp-san-francisco\">turning bbPress into a plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With every beta comes more feedback and the closer we get to release, the more feedback that comes in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As we upgrade WordPress.org and receive more feedback, we fix more things.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;With a small team, there&#8217;s no dedicated resources on the project which is the same problem that existed in 2014 when I did my <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/john-james-jacoby-launches-indiegogo-campaign-to-fund-buddypress-bbpress-and-glotpress-development\">Indiegogo campaign</a>. I&#8217;m really trying to spend a lot of time working on it but I&#8217;m also spending a lot of time on the security team, contributing to WordPress core, Multisite, and other projects. bbPress is my focus for as much as I can afford it to be.</p>\n<p>&#8220;bbPress 2.6 will ship, I promise, and it will be a better bbPress than it has ever been.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jacoby confirmed that there will likely be a third beta released sometime in the near future. Those who have upgraded to bbPress 2.6 Beta 2 are <a href=\"https://bbpress.org/forums/topic/bbpress-2-6-beta/page/3/#post-183637\">reporting substantial performance improvements</a>.</p>\n<p>If you use bbPress 2.5 and want to upgrade to 2.6 Beta 2, Jacoby encourages users to create a full backup of the site&#8217;s database as the upgrade migrates data for subscriptions and favorites. These changes are not easily reverted should you choose to downgrade back to 2.5.</p>\n<p>For your convenience, I&#8217;ve clipped the portion from the full interview that includes our conversation about bbPress and BuddyPress that you can listen too below.</p>\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/John-James-Jacoby-Gives-bbPress-2.6-Update.mp3\">https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/John-James-Jacoby-Gives-bbPress-2.6-Update.mp3</a>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 May 2017 20:19:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: New WordPress Plugin Blocks Spam User Registrations Using Stop Forum Spam Database\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69810\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-blocks-spam-user-registrations-using-stop-forum-spam-database\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3435:\"<p>When it comes to spam, comments are one of the first things that comes to mind. However, spam user registrations can be just as prolific on sites with open registration. Leland Fiegel, founder of <a href=\"https://themetry.com/\">Themetry</a>, has developed a new plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stop-signup-spam/\">Stop Signup Spam</a> that prevents users from registering an account if their email or IP address is on the <a href=\"http://stopforumspam.com/\">Stop Forum Spam</a> database.</p>\n<p>Stop Forum Spam is a free service that records reports of spam registrations from blogs, forums, wikis, and more. Stop Signup Spam integrates with the WordPress registration form and Restrict Content Pro. Fiegel launched a new site over the weekend and despite not announcing it, it received a handful of spam registrations.</p>\n<p>After Googling the registrants&#8217; email addresses, he discovered a number of them were reported on Stop Forum Spam&#8217;s site. &#8220;I had never heard of Stop Forum Spam before, but it is basically an Akismet equivalent for forum sign up spam,&#8221; Fiegel said. &#8220;I noticed they had a dead link to a WordPress plugin. I looked up the <a href=\"http://stopforumspam.com/usage\">Stop Forum Spam API documentation</a> and built a basic one myself a couple of days ago. I submitted it to WordPress.org and it was approved within a day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When a user is blocked from registering, the following error is displayed: Cannot register. Please contact site administrator for assistance.</p>\n<p>Although users can check the<a href=\"http://stopforumspam.com/search\"> Stop Forum Spam database</a> to see if their email or IP address is blocked, the error message doesn&#8217;t inform them that Stop Forum Spam is what blocked their registration.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wanted to keep the error message vague so users wouldn&#8217;t lash out at site administrators for accusing them of being &#8216;spammers&#8217; but clear enough that the site administrator would know it was a false positive when it was reported to them,&#8221; Fiegel said.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stop-signup-spam/\">plugin&#8217;s description</a>, Fiegel is clear about <a href=\"https://www.stopforumspam.com/privacy\">what data</a> is sent to the service. Each time a user attempts to register an account, an API call that contains the user&#8217;s email and IP address is sent to Stop Forum Spam and checked against its database. Although the plugin uses the service&#8217;s API, it does not require users to register for an API key. This allows the plugin to function upon activation without having to configure anything. Registrants that are incorrectly blocked as spammers can <a href=\"http://stopforumspam.com/removal\">submit a request</a> to have their IP or email address removed from the database.</p>\n<p>Fiegel has no plans to integrate support for other forms but is open to <a href=\"https://github.com/lelandf/stop-signup-spam\">pull requests</a> from those who would like to contribute integration support of their own. I did not test this plugin on an active site, but Fiegel says it has dramatically cut down on the number of spam registrations on his new site.

It has more than 290,000 recipes that reach millions of users every single day. <a href=\"http://www.nefisyemektarifleri.com/\">NefisYemekTarifleri</a> is a unique platform that uses WordPress and BuddyPress for all its applications &#8212; desktop, mobile web, Android, iOS, and AndroidTV.</p>\n<p><strong>Current status:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>290k+ recipes, <code>~500</code> new recipes from different authors per day</li>\n<li><code>~2.2M+</code> registered users with <code>~2.6M</code> xprofile_data, 24M+ usermeta</li>\n<li><code>~4M</code> native apps download, <code>~1M</code> active usage</li>\n<li><code>~100TB</code> CDN BW usage per month</li>\n<li>3M+ BuddyPress activities and <code>~4M+</code> notifications</li>\n<li>300k+ search requests per day</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use <a href=\"https://uysalmustafa.com/2016/04/12/how-to-scale-10m-search-request-with-elasticpress/\">ElasticPress to handle 10M+ requests</a>. To scale this platform, we use various tools which we <a href=\"https://stackshare.io/nefisyemektarifleri-com/nefisyemektarifleri\">share at Stackshare</a>. We share some of our stats on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=nytstats&src=typd\">#nytstats</a>.</p>\n<h2>BuddyPress for a Growing User Base</h2>\n<p>NefisYemekTarifleri.com is turning 10 years old this August and has been using BuddyPress for the last 5 years. According to my boss, “BuddyPress has helped a lot to increase our user base.”</p>\n<p>Our platform is community-driven, i.e., all the recipes come from our users. The membership and number of recipes submitted have increased dramatically since we started using BuddyPress. The users feel more welcome because they have their &#8220;own space&#8221; where they can easily add their avatars, cover images, post their recipes, and share other social media links. BuddyPress has enabled users to engage more with other registered members as well as invite new users to the site. Our editorial team spends a majority of their time editing user recipe submissions.</p>\n<p>Currently, we are using all BuddyPress core components except Friends and Groups. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/r-a-y\">r-a-y</a>‘s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-followers/\">BuddyPress Followers</a> plugin is a great replacement to the built-in Friends component.</p>\n<h2>Customized BuddyPress Features</h2>\n<h3>Notifications</h3>\n<p>Our notification system is quite different from the standard BuddyPress notifications. It supports push and web push notifications and works async over the message queue.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-265786\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/nyt-notification-1024x512.jpg\" alt=\"Site notifications schema\" width=\"700\" height=\"350\" /></p>\n<p>There are a lot of activities which can trigger notifications. There were and are many instances when we send notifications to tens of thousands users every day. For example, when one author with thousands of &#8220;followers&#8221; publishes a new recipe, it took a long time to send a simple notification like, “Hi there! Jane Doe published a new recipe, take a look!” Consider when we have 10 authors with many followers publishing new recipes at the same time.</p>\n<p>In the early days, we created a custom `nyt_bp_add_notification` script which called BuddyPress’ own notification that added a function for bulk messaging. We found out that it was causing lags on our slave MySQL servers because the impact on the disk IO was dramatic. Our solution was a new custom script, `nyt_bp_add_bulk_notification`, which inserts data directly to database (as a bulk SQL query). By the way, we highly recommend Percona’s <a href=\"https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html\">PMM</a> for catching performance hogs.</p>\n<p>At the end of 2016, we migrated from parse.com to our <a href=\"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server\">self hosted parse</a> for push notifications. After which, we used <a href=\"https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push-php\">web-push-php</a> for the web push notifications.</p>\n<h3>Cover Image</h3>\n<p>We decided to replace the built-in cover image feature and create our own Facebook-inspired UI which was more user-friendly. The feedback has been quite positive from our members.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uysalmustafa.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/cover-image.gif\" width=\"981\" height=\"398\" alt=\"New cover image UI\" class=\"alignnone size-large\" /></p>\n<p>Features of our new cover image UI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A user can directly upload a cover image by clicking on an icon on top of the cover image area.</li>\n<li>The full-size image is saved behind the scenes.</li>\n<li>Quick image resizing after the image upload has completed.</li>\n<li>A user can change image position via drag-drop.</li>\n<li>The full path and image coordinates are recorded as meta.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Messages</h3>\n<p>The Messaging component is active but not fully open for the end users. We will make this available for everyone when we&#8217;ve completed our mobile app integration. This is how we are setting this up for our site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All messages have to be between two people, we canceled group messaging.</li>\n<li>When someone you are not following sends a message, that message is marked as “pending”. You also &#8220;block&#8221; that person.</li>\n<li>Fluent messaging: all conversations between two people use the same thread.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Workarounds/Hacks/Yikes!</h2>\n<p><strong>Cache:</strong> We hated touching BuddyPress directly, but we had to hack core file to fix memory issues.  (We have submitted <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/7130/7130.diff\">a patch </a>that reduces memory usage for <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7130\">BP#7130</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Messaging, reimagined</strong>: We made some necessary changes a bit in a hacky way on the messaging component. Changing messaging behavior was not easy and there are some edge cases we have to monitor and address.</p>\n<p><strong>Limit notifications</strong>: Only allow 200 notifications per user, WordPress’ cron cleans up on a daily basis.</p>\n<p><strong>API Endpoints</strong>: We had to be careful on managing API endpoints, addressing the mobile apps a bit differently than web, especially when you do caching inside the device.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-running process</strong>: MQ workers are long-running PHP scripts and they caused memory problems on production after a while. We fixed this issue with <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress/blob/157e65b112d90bcc15e532dc33f86592805cdb13/bin/wp-cli.php#L795\">stop_the_insanity</a>.</p>\n<h2>In the Works</h2>\n<p>Following are some of the features we have in queue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrading BuddyPress, of course</li>\n<li>Elasticsearch integration over ElasticPress. (We haven&#8217;t tried it yet but <a href=\"https://github.com/swissspidy\">Pascal</a> already wrote <a href=\"https://github.com/swissspidy/wptalents/blob/feature/buddypress-integration/classes/core/ElasticPress.php\">some code</a> we can start playing with.)</li>\n<li>User suggestion to follow a member.</li>\n<li>Activity improvements (currently, just acting like feed).</li>\n<li>PHP 7.1 upgrade with dockerizing all the things. (Still using different versions of PHP)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BuddyPress allows us to build one of the largest niche communities in the world. Fortunately for everyone, BuddyPress is being maintained by developers who are active contributors to WordPress core. Our thanks to all BuddyPress contributors, especially the BP core team.</p>\n<div><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-265793\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/m_uysl.jpeg\" alt=\"Mustafa Uysal\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /> <em><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/m_uysl\">Mustafa Uysal</a> of <a href=\"http://www.nefisyemektarifleri.com/\">NefisYemekTarifleri.com</a> also runs his own company, <a href=\"http://skop.com.tr/\">SKOP</a>.

Co-founder Rémy Berda reports that there are now more than 10,000 websites using Weglot and the company has passed 30K€ in monthly revenue.</p>\n<p>Over the past six months Berda and his small team have been working to add improvements based on user feedback. Weglot will now detect a visitor&#8217;s language and automatically redirect to serve the translated page. Weglot users can also connect with <a href=\"https://www.textmaster.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Textmaster</a>&#8216;s marketplace to order professional translations through their accounts. The support burden has also increased from 10-20 emails per day to more than 80 per day, challenging the small team&#8217;s resources.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Over the past few months, we started to be overworked by the amount of support or the number of features we wanted to add to the product,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;We got a bit frustrated not to be able to improve the product as we wanted to through lack of time. So we understood that if we wanted to keep growing at a fast pace, we would need to scale up our two-person company and raising money was the perfect way to do it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After making the connection with SIDE Capital at the end of 2016, Weglot decided to partner with them to fund the further expansion if its support team. The team is currently comprised of two founders, one lead developer, one head of support, and one support agent. Approximately 1,500 of Weglot&#8217;s 10,000 users are on an active paid plan, but the remaining 85% of free users make up a significant portion of the support load. Berda said they are investing their resources in support, which serves both free and paid users, in order to maintain the same quality.</p>\n<p>In tandem with improving the performance of the plugin and its support, Berda said the team is also developing other integrations to test Weglot&#8217;s service outside of the WordPress market.</p>\n<p>Weglot is growing rapidly in the North American market. Although the Asian market is not represented on the plugin&#8217;s user breakdown below, Berda said it has more than doubled in the past two months.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have been seeing an accelerating growth in the Americas in the past 6 months,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;We went from 5% of our clients to 25% now. Asia is still small but has been quickly growing in the past two months from 3% to 8%.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/weglot-users-countries-breakdown.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>One year after officially launching Weglot, Berda and his team have found that WordPress is a ripe market for entrepreneurs who are ready to move quickly and provide a high level of customer service. His advice to newcomers?</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in the right place,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;WordPress is a huge market with real needs, and it is often overlooked by many entrepreneurs. There is an active and strong community with &#8216;caring&#8217; values.  So WordPress is definitely a great place to build a business.&#8221; He recommends keeping to a brisk timeline:</p>\n<p>&#8220;One month after you have the idea, you must have some people (1 to 10) testing a MVP,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;One more month later, you must have your first paying customer to validate the needs. Finally, never neglect customer support. Done carefully, customer supports transforms into customer acquisition.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 May 2017 20:13:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8 Release Targeted for June 8\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69778\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-release-targeted-for-june-8\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2349:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gutenberg-editor.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 kicked off in this week&#8217;s core developer meeting and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/4-8/\" target=\"_blank\">schedule</a> for the upcoming release is now published. Beta 1 is scheduled for May 12 and the official release is targeted for June 8. This will be the first major release in 2017 and is focused on laying the foundation for the new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg</a> editor. The schedule identifies the features that contributors are aiming to ship in 4.8:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TinyMCE inline element / link boundaries</li>\n<li>New media widgets</li>\n<li>WYSIWYG in text widget</li>\n<li>WordCamp / meetup dashboard upgrade to the “news” section</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Several contributors expressed concern during the meeting about the compressed timeline, as both the beta and RC testing times have roughly half the time they have been given in the past. Also, the release&#8217;s close proximity to WordCamp Europe, which officially begins activities the following week, presented additional concerns about the added workload of a release within the May/June timeframe.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think people are thinking of this as a normal release, a train leaving the station that a bunch of stuff (multisite! meta!) has to get on to make it in,&#8221; 4.8 release lead Matt Mullenweg said. &#8220;I agree that needs a much longer timeframe.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What is really going on is that we have a few simple, already working as plugin enhancements that add a few files, and we want to get those in the hands of users sooner rather than later. We already update TinyMCE all the time. Potential breakage or compatibility should be limited to things that interact with the text widget or the news dashboard module.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After a brief discussion on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/04/dev-chat-summary-may-3rd-4-8-week-1/\" target=\"_blank\">dev meeting notes</a>, the proposed schedule was confirmed. The feature project merge deadline is coming up on May 10, followed by Beta 1 two days later. Any enhancements that are not ready to proceed on this timeline will be put on hold for a future release.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 May 2017 18:13:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WPTavern: WPHugs: A Community Devoted to Educating, Discussing, and Raising Awareness of Mental Health\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69625\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://wptavern.com/wphugs-a-community-devoted-to-educating-discussing-and-raising-awareness-of-mental-health\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3983:\"<p>In the past two years, there has been an increased effort in the WordPress community to raise awareness of mental health. <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/10/cory-miller-managing-your-iceberg/\">Cory Miller</a>, <a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/n53MNL3C\">Rich Robinkoff</a>, <a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/fBYZcOBz\">Michele Butcher</a>, and <a href=\"https://wphugs.org/talks/\">others</a> have presented on the subject at numerous WordCamps.</p>\n<p>A common theme that surrounds mental health is the fear of discussing it openly. <a href=\"https://wphugs.org/\">WPHugs.org</a>, a passion project by Leo Gopal, aims to provide a safe space for people to connect, educate, and raise awareness of mental health.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I suffered many times in my life so far with extreme depression,&#8221; Gopal said. &#8220;One of the most difficult parts of dealing with extreme depression is the feeling that you can&#8217;t tell anyone about it. This can include your boss or colleagues who you spend most of your time with.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Until, at <a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/dhGqDhV5\">WordCamp Cape Town 2016</a>, I stood in front of a conference room full of people and &#8216;confessed&#8217; that I am afflicted with depression. After the talk, many people came to me and called me &#8216;brave&#8217; to be so open, and many opened up and thanked me for helping them realize that they too are not alone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After my recovery from attempted suicide, it was the friends I had made in the WordPress Community that gave me the most support. I reached my darkest point, and I got there feeling alone. WPHugs hopes to be a torch that allows others to never get to such a space.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WPHugs has a <a href=\"https://wphugs.org/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation\">Slack group</a> that&#8217;s free to join that provides an opportunity for like-minded people to discuss topics in real-time. While the conversations in the Slack channel are not private, Gopal is hopeful that the community will be built around trust and honesty.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I suspect that there will be more direct messages than there will be channel messages, and that&#8217;s okay, the connections are being made, we are talking more,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>WPHugs is a not-for-profit passion project and although the site has <a href=\"https://wphugs.org/sponsorships/\">sponsorship opportunities</a> available, Gopal is looking for companies and people who can contribute time and resources.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If companies want to contribute licenses to their software to help expand, grow, reach more people, by all means it is completely welcome,&#8221; Gopal said. &#8220;Sponsor time or resources, whatever you can to make this project thrive and survive, because it&#8217;s important, it could save someone&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gopal admits he&#8217;s not an authority on how to maintain good mental health but plans to crowdsource tips, tricks, and host conversations to help others. Heavily inspired by <a href=\"http://heropress.com/\">HeroPress</a>, Gopal wants to publish weekly essays called Mental Health War Stories.</p>\n<p>The most important message WPHugs wants to get across is that people who are suffering from mental illnesses are not alone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about making us aware of ourselves, taking care of our own mental health and how important it is for those around us. It&#8217;s also about being more empathetic for those around us who suffer in their own way and know that someone cares,&#8221; Gopal said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I went through a struggle discovering my mental illness and learning about it, and I did it alone. I don&#8217;t want that journey for others to be as solitary. I am a hugger.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To share a mental health war story or to get involved with the project, you can get in touch with Gopal through the WPHugs <a href=\"https://wphugs.org/contact/\">contact form</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 May 2017 02:39:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: WordPress Security Issue in Password Reset Emails to Be Fixed in Future Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69665\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-security-issue-in-password-reset-emails-to-be-fixed-in-future-release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4135:\"<p>Security researcher Dawid Golunski of <a href=\"https://legalhackers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Legal Hackers</a> has published the details of an <a href=\"https://exploitbox.io/vuln/WordPress-Exploit-4-7-Unauth-Password-Reset-0day-CVE-2017-8295.html\" target=\"_blank\">unauthorized password reset vulnerability</a> in WordPress core. Golunski demonstrated how, under certain circumstances, an attacker could intercept the password reset email and gain access to a user&#8217;s account.</p>\n<p>His proof of concept takes advantage of WordPress using the SERVER_NAME variable to get the hostname of the server in order to create a From/Return-Path header of the outgoing password reset email.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Major web servers such as Apache by default set the SERVER_NAME variable using the hostname supplied by the client (within the HTTP_HOST header):</p>\n<p>https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#usecanonicalname</p>\n<p>Because SERVER_NAME can be modified, an attacker could set it to an arbitrary domain of his choice e.g:</p>\n<p>attackers-mxserver.com</p>\n<p>which would result in WordPress setting the $from_email to </p>\n<p>wordpress@attackers-mxserver.com</p>\n<p>and thus result in an outgoing email with From/Return-Path set to this malicious address.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The results of this particular attack would depend on the server environment, the specific configuration of the mail server, and in some cases would require interaction from the user in question. Golunski&#8217;s <a href=\"https://exploitbox.io/vuln/WordPress-Exploit-4-7-Unauth-Password-Reset-0day-CVE-2017-8295.html\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> has a more specific breakdown of the possible methods that could be employed.</p>\n<p>After reporting the issue to the WordPress security team in July 2016 and also via the HackerOne website, Golunski saw no progress on it and decided to release the vulnerability details to the public.</p>\n<p>Although there is no official patch yet, WordPress Security Czar Aaron Campbell said the issue is not quite as severe as it may seem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lower priority issue, but we are aware of it and it is in our queue to address,&#8221; Campbell said. He explained the unique set of conditions that would be required in order for this to be a serious vulnerability.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In order for the issue to have a security impact, a server needs to allow a user-supplied header to overwrite <code>$_SERVER[\'SERVER_NAME\']</code>,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;We would consider that a poor server configuration (like leaving <code>display_errors</code> on on a production server), which is unfortunately outside our control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Campbell tested his personal Apache and nginx servers and none of them allowed for this. In addition to having a poorly configured server, Campbell said one of the following actions also needs to happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a user needs to reply to a password reset email</li>\n<li>an auto-reply needs to reply to the E-Mail and include the original</li>\n<li>an E-Mail server has to be compromised or overloaded and the message returned to sender with content intact</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;If your server is susceptible and you don&#8217;t have the ability to fix the actual server configuration, you still don&#8217;t have to make changes to WordPress files to mitigate the issue,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;A little PHP like this in a plugin will set the from E-Mail to a static E-Mail address of your choice:&#8221;</p>\n<p><code>add_filter( \'wp_mail_from\', function( $from_email ) { return \'wordpress@mysite.com\'; } );</code></p>\n<p>Campbell said any changes WordPress makes to core will likely be done via a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25239\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> that is currently tracking the issue from a non-security perspective. He said a fix is mostly likely not going to be coming in the next security release, but the team is actively working on it. If they find a good mitigation for the issue, Campbell said they will share it once they have worked through all the potential ramifications.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 May 2017 22:41:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: WordPress Community Team Considers New Retreat-Style WordCamp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69642\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-team-considers-new-retreat-style-wordcamp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3741:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/journey.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/2DEL42UQ7M\">Jesse Bowser</a>\n<p>The WordPress Community Team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/05/03/a-new-type-of-wordcamp/\" target=\"_blank\">debating the merits of a new type of WordCamp</a>, a hybrid event with the traditional WordCamp content in a retreat-style format. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mahype/\" target=\"_blank\">Sven Wagener</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Meetup-Koln/\" target=\"_blank\">Köln meetup group</a> in Germany, which has more than 700 members, have proposed a new style of camp that would potentially be called &#8220;WordCamp in the Green&#8221; or &#8220;WordCamp Retreat.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The event would be held outside of town at a venue where all attendees stay in the same hotel. In addition to the regular WordCamp sessions and Contributor Day, attendees have the opportunity to participate in local outdoor activities.</p>\n<p>The WordPress Community Team is open to considering different formats for WordCamps that serve a specific niche. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-for-publishers-to-be-held-in-denver-august-17-19\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp for Publishers</a>, the first WordCamp focused around a specific topic, is a recent example of this flexibility.</p>\n<p>The proposed format is very similar to the interest-based meetups that the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/community-translation-and-wapuu-how-japan-is-shaping-wordpress-history\" target=\"_blank\">Japanese WordPress community</a> has been doing for years. Members spend time together in activities unrelated to WordPress, as opposed to simply focusing on improving technical skills, and as a result they become more connected with their local community. For example, the <a href=\"http://2014onsen.wbsendai.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Word温泉 (WordOnsen) meetup</a> includes members who enjoy hot springs. They gather in Fukushima where they stay at the same hotel, host WordPress sessions, and end with a party night. This format has successfully grown the Japanese meetup community to more than 50 local groups.</p>\n<p>The Köln meetup group&#8217;s proposal for a WordCamp doesn&#8217;t stray too far from the traditional WordCamp program, as the only differences seem to be a more rural setting where everyone stays at the same venue. A more radical change would be an event where WordPress community members meet simply for networking and connecting with no planned educational component. These types of niche unofficial WordCamps have been happening for years outside of the WordPress-sanctioned events.</p>\n<p>The WordPress Community Team is seeking feedback on the proposed &#8220;WordCamp Retreat,&#8221; as approval of the event would set a precedent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we introduce a new type of WordCamp event like this, we want it to be something that works in many communities, scales effectively for larger (or smaller) groups, and is able to be reproduced by any organizers who wish to do so,&#8221; Commnity Team member Hugh Lashbrooke said.</p>\n<p>The organizing team for the proposed WordCamp has already prepared a budget and is ready to move forward once given approval. Lashbrooke said the Community Team anticipates the new event types will have &#8220;a huge amount of interest from other communities around the world,&#8221; so they wanted to pitch it to the community for feedback.</p>\n<p>If you have strong opinions on the topic, you can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/05/03/a-new-type-of-wordcamp/\" target=\"_blank\">join the discussion on WordPress.org</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 May 2017 02:05:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 271 – Recapping WordCamp Chicago 2017 With John James Jacoby\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=69622&preview=true&preview_id=69622\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-271-recapping-wordcamp-chicago-2017-with-john-james-jacoby\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2066:\"<p>In this episode, I&#8217;m joined by <a href=\"https://jjj.blog/\">John James Jacoby</a>.

To use it, you&#8217;ll first have to install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-web-suite/\">Social Media Suite connector Plugin</a> to connect your site to the service.</p>\n<p>Once activated, click the Go to Control Panel button which loads Social Web Suite&#8217;s control panel where you can connect social media accounts.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>I highly recommend that you open the control panel in a new browser tab as opening it in the same browser tab makes it difficult to browse back to the WordPress backend.</p>\n<p>Through Social Web Suite, users can publish or schedule Tweets and other messages across social networks such as Facebook. After connecting my Twitter account, I was able to publish a Tweet from the site&#8217;s interface.</p>\n<img />Social Media Suite Twitter Interface\n<p>Social Web Suite includes a number of sharing options. You can configure whether or not to share posts, pages, or both, how many times they can be shared, if the featured image is displayed, and if content is shared at the same time it&#8217;s published.</p>\n<p>Other configuration options include, message formatting, hashtag support, which categories to include or exclude, and the ability to exclude specific pages or posts.<img /></p>\n<p>To see how well messages are performing, Social Web Suite offers an analytics dashboard that displays a similar set of statistics provided by Twitter. This allows you to quickly see which messages are having the most impact.</p>\n<img />Social Media Suite Analytics Dashboard\n<p>As far as privacy is concerned, Social Media Suite stores marketing management content on its servers and will not ask users for their login information. The service is currently in Beta and is available by <a href=\"https://socialwebsuite.com/get-your-invitation/\">invitation only</a>. I tested <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-web-suite/\">Social Media Suite</a> on WordPress 4.7.4 and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues.

In the beginning it was going to be the short(ish) story of my first year with WordPress and the lessons I’ve learned about myself. It always ends up being a long and boring story of a year of my life without ever getting to the purpose of why I want to share it. I’ve decided to over simplify it as much as possible, in order to get to the ‘why’. If you really want to read about my ‘WordPress Year 1’ you can probably put most of it together from reading my blog for 2016.</p>\n<p>So in the spirit of TL;DR:</p>\n<p>After an amazing first WordCamp experience at WordCamp Cape Town 2015 I chose the path of freelance WordPress developer. My current situation doesn&#8217;t lend itself to being employed full time and I decided (at the time possibly stupidly) that building WordPress websites was what I was going to do. It would be easy right?</p>\n<blockquote><p>I had a developer license for the Divi theme and all I had to do was find small business clients to build websites for. What could possibly go wrong?</p></blockquote>\n<p>I spent the first year banging my head against a quite a few walls, trying to expand my mind, my skills and my experience to reach a goal that, for me anyway, was wholly unobtainable. In the end I realised the what I needed to do was trust in myself and my experience, find a better system for obtaining work and focus on the areas that I was actually good at.</p>\n<p>I also learned the importance of community.</p>\n<p>What follows are the notes I would send to myself, were I able to send a time capsule back one year, to be read on January 1, 2016. Hopefully it helps someone else out there.</p>\n<h3>The WordPress community is an amazing thing.</h3>\n<p>I’ve often said that the reason everyone in the community is (mostly) so open and welcoming and helpful is that it was founded in the spirit of open source. Open source software at it’s core is about being free, open and available, the ability to question a specific solution and find answers to problems and being able to extend and adapt to new requirements. The WordPress community is that in spades. Sure, there are some aspects of it that can get brutal or nasty, sometimes some parts of the community feel unheard or ignored and when I read about things like that it makes me sad. In my experience it has been a positive part of my journey.</p>\n<blockquote><p>From the local WordPress South Africa Slack team, to the two WordCamps in Cape Town and Johannesburg I attended this year, all the way to the international Slacks, forums and Facebook groups, almost everyone I’ve dealt with is positive and supportive.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’ve contacted CEOs and owners of premium WordPress business, asking them questions via Slack. Every time they answered. In what corporate culture does the owner or CEO of a company take time to answer some random developer question? I’ve met some amazing people, locally and internationally, in person and online, and they have all been the same. Friendly, helpful and willing to answer questions. I can honestly say that without the help and support of the WordPress community I would have been able to make it ‘on my own’ last year.</p>\n<h3>Being a freelancer is more about finding your purpose and less about finding clients.</h3>\n<p>I spent the majority of 2016 trying to force myself down a new path. One where I had little or no experience and where I was surrounded by giants. My gut told me that clients would be looking for websites. So building websites with WordPress became the logical step. However I am not a web designer, a content strategist or an SEO expert. In the words of Jeremy Clarkson, ‘How hard can it be?’. I soon learned how hard. While it is good to try and expand on your weaknesses, trying to earn an income this way is eventually going to kill you. The path to true work/life fulfilment lies at the intersection of that which you love, that which you are good at, that which the world needs and (most importantly) that which you can be paid for (the Japanese call it ‘Ikigai’, roughly translated as ‘a reason for being’).</p>\n<blockquote><p>The biggest mistake I made was thinking that because of WordPress there would be no work for a PHP developer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I soon learned that the reality was that because of WordPress there was an abundance of work for a PHP developer, I was just looking at it the wrong way. Once I knew what my Ikigai was, finding the right platform and clients to match that became much, much easier.</p>\n<h3>Never judge your experience based on someone else.</h3>\n<p>I’ll be the first to admit, I’m not the most up to date of developers. I only recently really grasped the concepts of name spacing and I still don’t quite get the whole MySQL character set thing. And that is OK. Being a developer is more about solving a problem than the tools you use to do so. There isn’t one ‘right’ way to build a plugin. There are a few recommended ways, which often differ from each other in small but important ways but they are all ‘the right way’. The important thing is to pay attention to things like standards, simplicity and security. Everything else can be learned from others. The beauty of an open source project is that everyone is learning from the community. So whatever I don’t know I can learn from someone else. At the end of the day the community benefits and you benefit. (also, refer back to ‘The WordPress community is an amazing thing’).</p>\n<h3>Look after yourself.</h3>\n<p>These seem obvious, but I soon found myself in some very bad patterns. Sleep was the first to go. It is way too easy to end up working until 1 or 2am, ‘just to get this one thing finished’. That’s great if you can sleep in the next morning, but when you are guaranteed to be woken at around 7am by your 5 year old, it soon starts adding up.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Once the sleep deprivation starts the bad food choices kick in.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Coffee becomes more of a crutch than an enjoyment and meal time decision making is ruled more by what tastes nice than what is healthy. Eventually you end up getting sick for a week and you are so run down you get nothing done until you recover, meaning your earning potential lessens. So you start trying to work longer hours. It is a vicious cycle. The problem, however, is actually a bit deeper&#8230;.</p>\n<h3>Your time is valuable.</h3>\n<p>The quickest way to the downward sleep/life cycle is to devalue yourself and your time.</p>\n<p>Learn to estimate better. Spend more (paid) time on researching the intricacies of a project to ensure you have thought about everything you can, then estimate accordingly. Otherwise you end up realising you missed something half way through, and you have to make a choice. Usually that choice is to suck up the time and add the feature. That is the wrong choice.</p>\n<p>Your time is valuable. It is better to admit to a client that you missed something and that you will need to adjust the time line or quote than to try and kill yourself to make it based on your original estimates. Worse case the client says no and cancels the project. Learn and apply the knowledge to the next one. Better case they agree to give you more time but not more money. Well at least you aren’t going to kill yourself to get it done. Best case they understand everyone is human. I’ve rarely found clients who don’t get it.</p>\n<h3>You are capable.</h3>\n<p>Have you ever experienced this? &#8211; You have a project coming up. You&#8217;ve done all the ground work and made sure you&#8217;ve estimated to the best of your abilities, but suddenly you are gripped with fear/concern/worry that the actual project is going to be above your capabilities. So you keep putting it off and do other less important things, trying to build up the courage to tackle it. When you eventually sit down and start you realise it is well within your capabilities and had you started sooner you would probably be done already, instead of now where you are a bit behind and you&#8217;ll have to either work in some extra time to make that deadline or come up with some excuse as to why you missed it.</p>\n<p>All. The. Damn. Time.</p>\n<p>Stop it. You can do it. You’ve done it a 100 times before. Trust in your experience and yourself.</p>\n<p>So in short, sleep more, worry less, rely on those around you and just get on with doing what you do best. It isn&#8217;t really much simpler than that. I’m still trying to figure out why I tried to make it more complicated than what it is, but perhaps that is another journey in the human psyche, for another day.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Notes From My Former Self\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Notes%20From%20My%20Former%20Self&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fnotes-from-my-former-self%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Notes From My Former Self\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fnotes-from-my-former-self%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fnotes-from-my-former-self%2F&title=Notes+From+My+Former+Self\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Notes From My Former Self\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/notes-from-my-former-self/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/050317-min-1-150x150.jpg&description=Notes From My Former Self\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Notes From My Former Self\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/notes-from-my-former-self/\" title=\"Notes From My Former Self\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/notes-from-my-former-self/\">Notes From My Former Self</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 May 2017 11:00:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Jonathan Bossenger\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"Akismet: Limited Time 20% Discount off all Jetpack Plans\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1931\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2017/05/03/discount-off-jetpack-plans/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1119:\"<p>As part of #SmallBusinessWeek, Jetpack and Akismet are offering a limited time 20% discount off all Jetpack&#8217;s <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/pricing/\">paid plans</a> &#8212;

In line with previous years&#8217; events that were hosted in major U.S. tech hubs (San Francisco and Austin), WooConf 2017 will be held in Seattle. The organizing team, which is made up of almost a dozen people from around the world of WooCommerce, is planning for 500 attendees.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce downloads have doubled from 12 million in 2016 to 24 million today. The plugin is active on more than 3 million websites and has a strong third-party plugin and theme ecosystem contributing to its growth.</p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s speaker lineup will feature more than 30 sessions aimed at developers, along with hands-on workshops. Organizers announced the event with a note that this edition of WooConf will cater specifically to developers:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Anyone who runs their business with WooCommerce will enjoy WooConf. However, we’re building out this year’s speaker list and workshops to appeal mainly to freelancers, agencies, WooExperts, and other developers working with WooCommerce on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>This includes anyone writing code, designing websites, or working with clients as a project manager or business owner. It also includes those of you who design, customize, and write code for your own store (or lend your services to a friend now and then).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Last year&#8217;s conference in Austin included content for both store owners and developers, and attendees were a mixture of experts and casual WooCommerce fans. The organizing team decided that the event could benefit from a more narrow focus.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Basically, we realized that we need to focus on either developers or store owners,&#8221; WooConf co-organizer Patrick Rauland said. &#8220;The content at last year&#8217;s WooConf was great. But you can&#8217;t have two priorities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to have a conference that&#8217;s remarkable, meaning people talk about it. There are a lot of great WordPress events and a lot of great e-commerce events. We want people to talk about WooConf in both of those circles. And by focusing on one target we hope to achieve that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Speaker submissions are already open and the suggested topics reflect this year&#8217;s developer focus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Running an Agency / Client Relations – Scoping projects, fostering repeat business, keeping projects on track, finding and hiring developers, productizing client functionality and so on.</li>\n<li>Extending WooCommerce – Using the REST API, JavaScript frameworks (React &#038; Backbone), case studies on customization, tips and tricks for customizing specific parts of WooCommerce (emails, checkout flow, product pages and so on) and accessibility.</li>\n<li>Scaling – Anything from server-side, backend, frontend or case studies</li>\n<li>eCommerce Fundamentals – Creating a cohesive experience (between multiple sites, apps, mobile sites, Amazon, etc), personalization, conversion rate optimization</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://wooconf.com/product/early-bird-ticket/\" target=\"_blank\">Early bird tickets</a> for WooConf are on sale for $499 until July 1 when the price will go up $200.</p>\n<p>Organizers will also be hosting the Golden Ticket competition this year, which offers prospective attendees the chance to win an all-expenses-paid trip to the event in Seattle, including travel, accommodation, and admission to the conference. Developers who want to be considered are asked to create a video showing how they use WooCommerce and post it to Instagram. The call for submissions will kick off later this month and the competition has historically been fairly stiff. In 2014, <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2014/08/case-study-o-v-e-r-clothing/\" target=\"_blank\">Sinisa from OVER Clothing</a> won out over 2,000 other entrants.</p>\n<p>WooConf 2017 will take place at <a href=\"https://www.bellharbor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bell Harbor International Conference Center</a>, within walking distance of Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and many hotels. For the thousands of WooCommerce developers and enthusiasts around the world who are not able to attend, a live streaming option will be available and recorded talks will be published after the event.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 May 2017 02:36:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"Akismet: Akismet WordPress Plugin 3.3.1 Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1928\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2017/05/02/akismet-wordpress-plugin-3-3-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1383:\"<p>Version 3.3.1 of <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> is now available.</p>\n<p>For a full list of the changes in this release, see the <a href=\"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/log/akismet/trunk?action=stop_on_copy&mode=stop_on_copy&rev=1649900&stop_rev=1604754+&limit=100&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=\">revision log</a>, but here are the highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A couple of bugs that could cause PHP warnings in the error log have been fixed.</li>\n<li>Performance has been improved by preventing some comments-specific code from running on pages without comments.</li>\n<li>Both the &#8220;Remove author URL&#8221; and link preview features now work after a comment is Quick Edited in wp-admin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions.

The company, which provides education for WordPress consultants, will be <a href=\"http://www.wpelevation.com/wp-elevation-mental-health-month/\" target=\"_blank\">focusing all of its content on mental health topics</a>, including blogs, podcasts, newsletters, and livestreams.</p>\n<p>The WP Elevation podcast will feature interviews with mental health experts on Thursdays throughout May:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>May 4: Ed Finkler from <a href=\"https://osmihelp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Sourcing Mental Illness</a>, interviewed by Gin McInneny</li>\n<li>May 11: Cory Miller from <a href=\"https://ithemes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">iThemes</a>, interviewed by Kristina Romero</li>\n<li>May 18: Andrew Pearce from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AnxietyTaskforce/\" target=\"_blank\">Anxiety Free Living</a>, interviewed by Cath Hughes</li>\n<li>May 25: Amy Felman – Psychologist and Podcast Presenter of <a href=\"http://weallwearitdifferently.com/\" target=\"_blank\">We All Wear it Differently</a>, interviewed by Mike Killen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WP Elevation founder Troy Dean said various employees at the company have been affected by mental health issues and are often conscious of how digital life can keep people separated from each other.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have experienced anxiety and depression in the past &#8211; to the point where I couldn’t get out of bed some days,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;I work very hard to manage my mental health these days through exercise, family life, and hobbies, as well as working hard in business which I find fulfilling. We will be sharing some of our personal stories on our blog during May.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Focusing on mental health topics is a drastic change from WP Elevation&#8217;s normal business topics, but Dean said he hasn&#8217;t even thought about how it might affect the company&#8217;s revenue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We all believe that mental health issues are still weighed down with a certain stigma and we want to encourage people to be more open in having these conversations,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;I actually don’t care whether it affects my revenue or not. Without good mental health, revenue is meaningless.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Working within the WordPress community comes with its own set of unique mental health risks, as many people have their lives deeply embedded in online work. Those who work remotely or by themselves have a greater likelihood of feeling isolated and cut off from others.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The digital life can keep us isolated for periods of time as we toil away on our projects in front of our computers,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;I’ve met a lot of WordPress users over the years at WordCamps who have confided in me that the events are so important because they get to connect with their tribe. I think there is also a risk of online bullying that can make people feel inadequate or ostracized.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WP Elevation will be supporting <a href=\"https://osmihelp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Sourcing Mental Illness</a> (OSMI), a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting mental wellness and providing resources for those facing mental illness in the tech community. The company is <a href=\"https://osmihelp.org/donate\" target=\"_blank\">promoting OSMI&#8217;s fundraising campaign</a> throughout the month alongside raising awareness around mental health-related topics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have no measurable goals for this initiative,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;It is not part of our marketing plan or some larger scheme for us. We have these conversations on a regular basis internally and some of our members have indicated it would be a good idea to have them publicly, so that’s what this is all about. If we can help one person feel less isolated or find the courage to reach out and ask for help when they need it, I’ll consider it a success.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 02 May 2017 03:59:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WPTavern: 10up Releases WP Docker, an Open Source Docker Configuration for Local WordPress Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69468\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"https://wptavern.com/10up-releases-wp-docker-an-open-source-docker-configuration-for-local-wordpress-development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3363:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/docker-logo.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2017/wp-docker/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Docker</a> is a new project from 10up that makes it easy to set up a local WordPress development environment with Docker. Last year 10up worked with <a href=\"https://www.joyent.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Joyent</a>, a cloud infrastructure company, to create a production-ready implementation of WordPress in Docker. After their experience with this project, 10up created WP Docker as a simple, open source development environment based on <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/\" target=\"_blank\">docker-compose</a>.</p>\n<p>Docker is a virtualization technology that allows developers to work on websites and applications in isolated containers. It has many advantages over Vagrant, which takes up a lot more space with each virtual machine having its own operating system included. Docker runs off of a single Linux instance and the containers hold the application and its dependencies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While still viable, VVV, Vagrant, and Virtual Box/Hyper-V take up extreme disk space and are slow to provision, start up, and SSH into,&#8221; 10up Director of Engineering Taylor Lovett said. &#8220;Because of this, engineers tend to use one &#8216;mega&#8217; VVV install for all of their development websites. This workflow poses a number of problems: system service version and configuration &#8216;normalization&#8217; across all projects (i.e. PHP 7 on everything when some projects run PHP 5.6 in production), and legacy clutter (i.e. old websites and system packages undeleted).&#8221;</p>\n<p>WP Docker is much more lightweight than VVV and starts up much faster. It comes packaged with Elasticsearch by default, so 10up&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/elasticpress/\" target=\"_blank\">ElasticPress</a> plugin works out-of-the-box. The environment includes the following technologies by default:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP7</li>\n<li>MariaDB</li>\n<li>NGINX</li>\n<li>Elasticsearch</li>\n<li>Gearman</li>\n<li>Memcached</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV\" target=\"_blank\">VVV</a> was started by a former 10up employee, Jeremy Felt, and the company still uses the project for local development in many cases. Certain instances, however, may lend themselves more to using VVV as opposed to WP Docker. Lovett said those include projects that are highly dependent on specific versions of system packages, such as PHP 5.6 and Elasticsearch 5.1.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP Docker lends itself well to enterprise clients that want to version control an environment specifically for their web application to be distributed to developers,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;This is common for large clients with large development teams. WP Docker lets a team standardize on a local setup which decreases bugs and &#8216;I see this but you don&#8217;t&#8217; issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lovett said teams at 10up are still using VVV more often than WP Docker since it&#8217;s still quite new, but the company plans to let project requirements and team preferences drive adoption. The project is <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/wp-docker\" target=\"_blank\">available on GitHub</a> and has nearly 80 stars less than a week after its release.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 01 May 2017 19:52:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"BuddyPress: Total Wellness Challenge: Fitness with BuddyPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=265691\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://buddypress.org/2017/05/total-wellness-challenge-fitness-with-buddypress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9175:\"<div><em>This a guest post by Tara Claeys (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/taraclaeys\">taraclaeys</a>) of <a href=\"https://designtlc.com/\">Design TLC, LLC</a>.

The business grew and Ginny expanded into nutrition and wellness coaching. As a result, she began offering “Challenges” on printed sheets to her clients a few years later. They could track their daily wellness activities (nutrition, fitness, and mental health) on the sheet, giving themselves points for good behaviors and subtracting points for negative activities. This “game” became popular among her clients, just as online wellness communities started offering similar experiences on websites and apps.</p>\n<p>Tara Claeys, a fitness client and friend, offered to help Ginny expand her existing WordPress site by adding a membership component, allow commenting to create interaction between members, and also include the ability for people to track their “Challenge Points” online using a Google Spreadsheet. This was the rudimentary beginning of the online program for her Challenges.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>In 2015, Ginny decided to brand her Challenges and decided to launch a separate website for this program, The <a href=\"https://twcfit.com/\">Total Wellness Challenge</a> (TWC). Her goal was to expand the program beyond her fitness clients and to offer branded Challenges for corporate wellness programs. Tara worked with her to create a multisite installation with BuddyPress and  MemberPress that would have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subsites for individual, private Challenges in corporate and other groups</li>\n<li>Restricted access to Challenges for members only</li>\n<li>Allow a “Reflections” commenting page for Challengers to interact with each other</li>\n<li>Point Logging for 3 components of the Challenge\n<ul>\n<li>Limit submission to same day after 8pm until next day until 5pm. </li>\n<li>Allow users to select one day to be a “Free” day where they would receive the maximum nutrition score, no matter what they ate</li>\n<li>Add a “bonus” point automatically if a user logs 5 consecutive 12-point days</li>\n<li>Show points for all Challengers on a Totals Page</li>\n<li>Limits to only one entry per user per day</li>\n<li>Each category (nutrition, fitness, lifestyle) has limit on max points per day </li>\n<li>Ability for admin to edit user points on the back end</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tara hired <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomaransom?lang=en\">Tom Ransom</a> of <a href=\"https://www.1bigidea.com/\">One Big Idea</a> to help develop a custom plugin that would connect MemberPress with BuddyPress. They chose BuddyPress because is primed for multisite configuration, it worked well with MemberPress, and is very customizable. Plus, the BuddyPress Groups functionality was a good fit for the separate Challenges. For TWC, each Challenge is a unique BuddyPress Group, set up on the front end by the admin. </p>\n<p>The TWC is a point-logging game at its core. Participants keep track of their activity throughout each day for about 4 weeks and must log in to the website each day to record their points. There are 3 components of the Challenge:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/groups-1024x313.png\" alt=\"TWC groups\" width=\"700\" height=\"214\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-265695\" /></p>\n<p><strong>1. Nutrition</strong>: Players can earn up to 12 points per day. Everyone starts the day with 5 points, and can gain points for positive food choices, such as avoiding white flour, eating 3 cups of greens and drinking a specified amount of water based on their weight. Players lose points for unhealthy choices, such as eating too much sugar, eating processed foods, and consuming more than one serving of beer or wine.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Fitness</strong>: Players can earn up to 2 points per day. They earn one point for doing 30 minutes or more of exercise per day and another point for stretching for at least 10 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Lifestyle</strong>: Players earn one point for posting a daily Reflection on the twcfit.com website, and a second point for participating in the lifestyle challenge of the week. Each week, a different lifestyle activity is listed, including behaviors such as noting 3 things you are grateful for each day, getting 7 hours of sleep, or doing an act of kindness for someone. A maximum of 2 lifestyle points can be earned each day.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/bbg-log-886x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Log Points\" width=\"700\" height=\"809\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-265720\" /></p>\n<p>The participant can go to the Totals page to check their score against other players.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/totals-1024x466.png\" alt=\"Totals page\" width=\"700\" height=\"319\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-265697\" /></p>\n<p>Tom’s plugin includes code that directs the PayPal IPN to the respective subsite for MemberPress (MP) purchases. In addition, this plugin adds the new MP user into the corresponding BuddyPress group once the MP transaction was returned compete.

For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>activity &gt; post-form.php customized “What is your reflection for the xx Challenge today, name?”</li>\n<li>groups &gt; single &gt; group-header.php &#8212; Adds RESOURCES button to header<br /><img src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/bp-customization.jpg\" alt=\"BuddyPress Customization\" width=\"235\" height=\"139\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-265719\" />\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The site also uses the  BuddyPress Custom Profile Menu and Custom User Profile Photo plugins.</p>\n<h2>Current Status</h2>\n<p>Over the past 13+ years, Ginny has hired 4 instructors, expanded her business to McLean, Virginia, and wrote the “<a href=\"http://bodybyginny.com/good-food-recipe-book-by-ginny-wright/\">Good Food Recipe Book</a>” which is available for sale on her website.  At this time, Ginny is still deciding whether she wants to invest in marketing Total Wellness Challenge or keep it small, mostly based on word of mouth. The increased competition in this space has made it harder to gain exposure without a large marketing budget.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://twcfit.com/\">Total Wellness Challenge</a> website has been running well for a little over a year. Six Challenges have been conducted so far, and participants have loved interacting with each other.

The plugin allowed users to create &#8220;Buy Buttons&#8221; for products from their Shopify stores and insert them into WordPress posts and pages using a shortcode. It was built by <a href=\"https://webdevstudios.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WebDevStudios</a> and had approximately 9,000 active installations before it was removed.</p>\n<p>Shopify&#8217;s <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/manual/sell-online/buy-button/wordpress-for-shopify\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> says the plugin has been discontinued and will not be supported after June 30, 2017. WordPress users who want to display Shopify products on their sites are now instructed to <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/manual/sell-online/buy-button/create-buy-button\" target=\"_blank\">create a Buy Button for a product or collection</a> and paste the embed code into WordPress instead.</p>\n<p>The WordPress plugin team would not comment on why the plugin was removed, but a support representative from Shopify said it was outdated and difficult to maintain.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The reason it was removed is that it was being replaced by Buy Button, which is a better way of selling in WordPress,&#8221; Shopify customer support representative Jacquelyn Failano said. &#8220;The WordPress plugin was built by a third party and even if we support it, it could break at any time as we make future updates to the Buy Button channel.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Failano said that by switching from using the plugin to creating Buy Buttons with Shopify, users will have access to updated features, including fonts, colors, layouts, buttons, and multiple images on variants. Merchants will also be in a better position to take advantage of future updates.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The plugin uses older code and methods that will no longer be updated or supported,&#8221; Failano said. &#8220;There is no longer a dedicated development team for it. This means that there are no resources to maintain or rebuild the plugin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Failano would not confirm whether or not the plugin was removed from the directory by Shopify at the company&#8217;s discretion or whether it was forcibly removed by WordPress for a violation of the guidelines.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I cannot confirm on that part &#8211; the main reason why it was discontinued was because the plugin uses older code and methods that will no longer be updated or supported,&#8221; Failano said.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 02:02:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: How the San Francisco WordPress Meetup is Using Open Collective to Fund Activities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69286\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"https://wptavern.com/how-the-san-francisco-wordpress-meetup-is-using-open-collective-to-fund-activities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5065:\"<p>In 2016, WordPress meetups had the fastest growth the community has seen in five or six years with more than 62,566 people attending in 58 different countries. Meetups are the seeds of future WordCamps. These local gatherings help users further their WordPress skills and underpin the community&#8217;s growth across the globe.</p>\n<p>Funding a local meetup can be a challenge, as organizers often have to seek out sponsors just like a WordCamp but at a smaller scale. The San Francisco WordPress meetup (WPSFO) is trying something new by publicly managing its budget and expenses with <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/wordpress-sf\" target=\"_blank\">Open Collective</a>. Last week we featured the service in an <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/open-collective-is-a-new-transparent-way-to-fund-open-source-projects\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> and WPSFO lead organizer Shannon Dunn commented on his meetup&#8217;s experience with it so far.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It creates a level of transparency for the whole community and lets current and prospective customers understand where the money goes,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;I&#8217;d say we&#8217;re pretty happy with it and it&#8217;s an integral part of managing our meetup.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wpsfo.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Dunn started attending and helping out with WPSFO in 2011 and stepped up to be lead organizer at the beginning of 2016. Former lead organizer Zach Berke, who started in 2007, was the one who initially suggested the idea of using Open Collective.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Before we started with Open Collective, sponsors paid for things directly,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had various host sponsors (Automattic, Exygy, Pantheon) that have provided meeting space, food, and drinks. These hosts have always paid for the food directly. We also had a relationship with WPEngine at one point. They paid a videographer to film the meetups. All other expenses, usually for minor things, were paid for by the organizers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dunn said that Open Collective has helped to reduce the out-of-pocket expenses for meetup organizers, as it provides a straightforward process for posting expenses and getting reimbursed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Funding a meetup can be pretty tough,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;It&#8217;s great that we have hosts to cover the big items, but various other expenses come up. Those small things are usually paid for by the organizers. Also, there are times when one of our primary hosts can&#8217;t provide a space to meet. We have several alternative meeting spaces but not all of them provide food and drinks. On those occasions, organizers have paid for the food and drink out of pocket. We could have gone without, but we try to keep each meetup a consistent experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dunn said the team wanted to cover these costs without digging into the pockets of the organizers, who already volunteer a lot of time and energy to the meetup. They do not charge for the events and don&#8217;t plan on doing it in the future, so having additional funds on hand became a priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Pia from Open Collective reached out to Zach about a year ago,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;Zach had a prior relationship with another OC founder, Xavier, from his early Storify days. Zach agreed to sign up for OC because it seemed to address a pain point. Zach handed the reins of OC to Michelle and I, who have brought sponsors onto the platform.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dunn said using Open Collective has had many positive advantages over the previous system WPSFO had for managing funds. Receiving donations and submitting expenses is now streamlined into a transparent pipeline. The meetup has an estimated annual budget of $6,658, based on current donations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Being able to provide recognition to our sponsors is a big plus,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;It&#8217;s worth noting that this is a young and ever-evolving platform so with that you&#8217;re provided direct access to Open Collective&#8217;s front line, which is beneficial in addressing any questions or concerns that arise.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dunn said using Open Collective has opened up additional possibilities, like making WPSFO t-shirts to sell to members and the general public. Having money in the meetup account means the organizers can do it without having to pre-sell the shirts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re floating in cash now, but we have little bit of money to work with,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;It feels great to have that and we&#8217;re deeply appreciative of our sponsors for making it possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WPSFO is one of <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/discover?show=meetup\" target=\"_blank\">23 meetups</a> that have started managing their budgets and funds through Open Collective. Other early adopters of the service include multiple WWCode meetups, Women Who Code Atlanta, and SF Data Science Meetup, with budgets ranging from a few hundred dollars to more than $25,000.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 18:55:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: WordCamp US 2017 Ramps Up Ticket Sales, Organizers Plan for 2,500 Attendees\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69357\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2017-ramps-up-ticket-sales-organizers-plan-for-2500-attendees\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2418:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/wordcamp-us-nashville.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Promotion for <a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp US 2017 in Nashville</a>, December 1-3, is now in full swing, as organizers have ramped up social media efforts to stimulate ticket sales.

Using a complex algorithm, Watsonfinds uses <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/watson/\">IBM&#8217;s Watson</a> to understand content like a human by reading and interpreting complete sentences, the reader’s language, and its context.</p>\n<p>Once activated, a new button is added to the editor toolbar. Clicking the button will send the content through an API to IBM&#8217;s Watson for analysis.</p>\n<p><img />Watsonfinds Toolbar ButtonWhen an analysis is completed, the results are displayed in a modal window. The report is broken down into five emotions: joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear.</p>\n<p><img />Watsonfinds AnalysisI submitted five posts of various length and each report was generated quickly. Here are the posts I submitted along with the most likely emotional response from readers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-to-close-san-francisco-office\">Automattic to Close San Francisco Office</a> &#8211; Sadness</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-shows-users-where-a-plugins-settings-link-is-upon-activation\">New WordPress Plugin Shows Users Where a Plugin’s Settings Link Is Upon Activation</a> &#8211; Sadness</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-4-fixes-visual-editor-incompatibility-with-upcoming-version-of-chrome\">WordPress 4.7.4 Fixes 47 Issues</a> &#8211; Sadness</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/heropress-partners-with-wpshout-to-offer-wordpress-education-scholarships\">HeroPress Partners With WPShout to Offer WordPress Education Scholarships</a> &#8211; Joy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/headway-themes-appears-to-be-dying-a-slow-death\">Headway Themes Appears to be Dying a Slow Death</a> &#8211; Anger</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Within the report is a timeline where you can compare results as you add or remove words to the post.</p>\n<p>During testing, I found the timeline confusing to use as I thought I had to save the post as a draft after each edit to generate a revision on the timeline. To use the timeline, you need to make changes to a post without saving it and then click the Watsonfinds button to generate a new report.</p>\n<p>Being able to see which words are generating the emotions depicted in the report would be a nice feature to have. Gutiérrez says that this feature is in the works and will be in the commercial version of the plugin. The More Insights tab in the report is an advertisement for the premium version which is not yet available.</p>\n<p>I tested the plugin on WordPress 4.7.4 and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues. While Watsonfinds isn&#8217;t going to change how I write, I can see the potential benefits of using such a plugin to try to illicit a certain emotional response from readers and customers whether it&#8217;s a renewal email, blog post, or other copy.</p>\n<p>You can try out <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/watsonfinds/\">Watsonfinds</a> for free by downloading it from the WordPress plugin directory.

This was true when Joost wrote his original <a href=\"https://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress SEO</a> article in 2008 (updated every few months) and it&#8217;s still true today, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t improve it further! This plugin is written from the ground up by Joost de Valk and his team at <a href=\"https://yoast.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast</a> to improve your site&#8217;s SEO on <em>all</em> needed aspects. While this <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast SEO plugin</a> goes the extra mile to take care of all the technical optimization, more on that below, it first and foremost helps you write better content.  Yoast SEO forces you to choose a focus keyword when you&#8217;re writing your articles, and then makes sure you use that focus keyword everywhere.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Premium Support</strong><br />\n  The Yoast team does not always provide active support for the Yoast SEO plugin on the WordPress.org forums. One-on-one email support is available to people who bought the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo-premium/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Premium Yoast SEO plugin</a> only.<br />\n  Note that the Premium SEO plugin has several extra features too, including the option to have multiple focus keywords and a redirect manager, so it might be well worth your investment!</p>\n<p>You should also check out the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/local-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast Local SEO</a>, <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast News SEO</a> and <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/video-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast Video SEO</a> extensions to Yoast SEO. These of course come with support too.</p>\n<p><strong>Bug Reports</strong><br />\n  Bug reports for Yoast SEO are <a href=\"https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo\" rel=\"nofollow\">welcomed on GitHub</a>. Please note GitHub is <em>not</em> a support forum, and issues that aren&#8217;t properly qualified as bugs will be closed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Write better content with Yoast SEO</h4>\n<p>Using the snippet preview, you can see a rendering of what your post or page will look like in the search results, whether your title is too long or too short, and whether your meta description makes sense in the context of a search result. This way the plugin will help you not only increase rankings but also increase the click through rate for organic search results.</p>\n<h4>Page Analysis</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugins <a href=\"https://yoast.com/content-seo-wordpress-linkdex/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Page Analysis</a> functionality checks simple things you&#8217;re bound to forget. It checks, for instance, if you have images in your post and whether they have an alt tag containing the focus keyword for that post. It also checks whether your posts are long enough, whether you&#8217;ve written a meta description and if that meta description contains your focus keyword, if you&#8217;ve used any subheadings within your post, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>The plugin alsgruo allows you to write meta titles and descriptions for all your category, tag and custom taxonomy archives, giving you the option to further optimize those pages.</p>\n<p>Combined, this plugin makes sure that your content is the type of content search engines will love!</p>\n<h4>Technical WordPress Search Engine Optimization</h4>\n<p>While out of the box WordPress is pretty good for SEO, it needs some tweaks here and there. This Yoast SEO plugin guides you through some of the settings needed, for instance by reminding you to enable pretty permalinks. But it also goes beyond that, by automatically optimizing and inserting the meta tags and link elements that Google and other search engines like so much:</p>\n<h4>Meta &amp; Link Elements</h4>\n<p>With the Yoast SEO plugin you can control which pages Google shows in its search results and which pages it doesn&#8217;t show. By default, it will tell search engines to index all of your pages, including category and tag archives, but to only show the first pages in the search results. It&#8217;s not very useful for a user to end up on the third page of your &#8220;personal&#8221; category, right?</p>\n<p>WordPress itself only shows canonical link elements on single pages, but Yoast SEO makes it output canonical link elements everywhere. Google has recently announced they would also use <code>rel=\"next\"</code> and <code>rel=\"prev\"</code> link elements in the <code>head</code> section of your paginated archives. This plugin adds those automatically. See <a href=\"https://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post</a> for more info.</p>\n<h4>XML Sitemaps</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin has the most advanced XML Sitemaps functionality in any WordPress plugin. Once you check the box, it automatically creates XML sitemaps and notifies Google &amp; Bing of the sitemaps&#8217; existence. These XML sitemaps include the images in your posts &amp; pages too, so that your images may be found better in the search engines too.</p>\n<p>These XML Sitemaps will even work on large sites, because of how they&#8217;re created, using one index sitemap that links to sub-sitemaps for each 1,000 posts. They will also work with custom post types and custom taxonomies automatically, while giving you the option to remove those from the XML sitemap should you wish to.</p>\n<p>Because of using <a href=\"https://yoast.com/xsl-stylesheet-xml-sitemap/\" rel=\"nofollow\">XSL stylesheets for these XML Sitemaps</a>, the XML sitemaps are easily readable for the human eye too, so you can spot things that shouldn&#8217;t be in there.</p>\n<h4>RSS Optimization</h4>\n<p>Are you being outranked by scrapers? Instead of cursing at them, use them to your advantage! By automatically adding a link to your RSS feed pointing back to the original article, you&#8217;re telling the search engine where they should be looking for the original. This way, the Yoast SEO plugin increases your own chance of ranking for your chosen keywords and gets rid of scrapers in one go!</p>\n<h4>Breadcrumbs</h4>\n<p>If your theme is compatible, and themes based on for instance Genesis or by WooThemes often are, you can use the built-in Breadcrumbs functionality. This allows you to create an easy navigation that is great for both users and search engines, and will support the search engines in understanding the structure of your site.</p>\n<p>Making your theme compatible isn&#8217;t hard either, check <a href=\"https://kb.yoast.com/kb/implement-wordpress-seo-breadcrumbs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">these instructions</a>.</p>\n<h4>Edit your .htaccess and robots.txt file</h4>\n<p>Using the built-in file editor, you can edit your WordPress blog&#8217;s <code>.htaccess</code> and <code>robots.txt</code> file, giving you direct access to the two most powerful files, from an SEO perspective, in your WordPress install.</p>\n<h4>Social Integration</h4>\n<p>SEO and Social Media are heavily intertwined. That&#8217;s why this plugin also comes with a Facebook OpenGraph implementation and will soon also support Google+ sharing tags.</p>\n<h4>Multi-Site Compatible</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin, unlike some others, is fully Multi-Site compatible. The XML Sitemaps work fine in all setups and you even have the option, in the Network settings, to copy the settings from one blog to another, or make blogs default to the settings for a specific blog.</p>\n<h4>Import &amp; Export functionality</h4>\n<p>If you have multiple blogs, setting up plugins like this one on all of them might seem like a daunting task. Except that it&#8217;s not, because what you can do is simple: you set up the plugin once. You then export your settings and simply import them on all your other sites. It&#8217;s that simple!</p>\n<h4>Import functionality for other WordPress SEO plugins</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve used All In One SEO Pack or HeadSpace2 before using this plugin, you might want to import all your old titles and descriptions. You can do that easily using the built-in import functionality. There&#8217;s also import functionality for some of the older Yoast plugins, like Robots Meta and RSS footer.</p>\n<p>Should you have a need to import from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO, or from a theme like Genesis or Thesis, you can use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-data-transporter/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SEO Data Transporter</a> plugin, which will easily convert your SEO meta data from and to a whole set of plugins like Platinum SEO, SEO Ultimate, Greg&#8217;s High Performance SEO, and themes like Headway, Hybrid, WooFramework, Catalyst etc.</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://yoast.com/all-in-one-seo-pack-migration/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this migration guide</a> if you still have questions about migrating from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO.</p>\n<h4>Yoast SEO Plugin in your Language!</h4>\n<p>Currently a huge translation project is underway, translating Yoast SEO in as much as 24 languages. So far, the translations for French and Dutch are complete, but we still need help on a lot of other languages, so if you&#8217;re good at translating, please join us at <a href=\"http://translate.yoast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">translate.yoast.com</a>.</p>\n<h4>News SEO</h4>\n<p>Be sure to also check out the premium <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">News SEO module</a> if you need Google News Sitemaps.

Import in the WordPress dashboard</li>\n<li>Click on the WordPress link in the list of importers</li>\n<li>Click &#8220;Install Now&#8221;</li>\n<li>Finally click &#8220;Activate Plugin &amp; Run Importer&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you would prefer to do things manually then follow these instructions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>wordpress-importer</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to the Tools -&gt; Import screen, click on WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n</dd>\n<dt>Help! I&#8217;m getting out of memory errors or a blank screen.</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>If your exported file is very large, the import script may run into your host&#8217;s configured memory limit for PHP.</p>\n<p>A message like &#8220;Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted&#8221; indicates that the script can&#8217;t successfully import your XML file under the current PHP memory limit. If you have access to the php.ini file, you can manually increase the limit; if you do not (your WordPress installation is hosted on a shared server, for instance), you might have to break your exported XML file into several smaller pieces and run the import script one at a time.</p>\n<p>For those with shared hosting, the best alternative may be to consult hosting support to determine the safest approach for running the import. A host may be willing to temporarily lift the memory limit and/or run the process directly from their end.</p>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Importing_Content#Before_Importing\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress Codex: Importing Content</a></p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><!--section=changelog--></p>\n<h4>0.6.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add support for import term metadata.</li>\n<li>Fix bug that caused slashes to be stripped from imported content.</li>\n<li>Fix bug that caused characters to be stripped inside of CDATA in some cases.</li>\n<li>Fix PHP notices.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add wp_import_existing_post filter.

Built to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, WooCommerce is the world’s favorite eCommerce solution that gives both store owners and developers complete control.</p>\n<p>With endless flexibility and access to hundreds of free and premium WordPress extensions, WooCommerce now powers 30% of all online stores &#8212; more than any other platform.</p>\n<iframe class=\'youtube-player\' type=\'text/html\' width=\'640\' height=\'390\' src=\'https://www.youtube.com/embed/1KahlicghaE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent\' allowfullscreen=\'true\' style=\'border:0;\'></iframe>\n<h4>Sell anything, anywhere</h4>\n<p>With WooCommerce, you can sell both physical and digital goods in all shapes and sizes, offer product variations, multiple configurations, and instant downloads to shoppers, and even sell affiliate goods from online marketplaces.</p>\n<p>With premium extensions, you can offer bookings, memberships, and recurring subscriptions. Perhaps you’d like to sell monthly subscriptions for physical goods, or offer your members a discount on digital downloads? It’s all possible.</p>\n<h4>Ship wherever you like</h4>\n<p>Offer free shipping, flat rate shipping, or make real-time calculations. Limit your shipments to specific countries, or open your store up to the world. Shipping is highly configurable, and WooCommerce even supports drop shipping.</p>\n<h4>Extensive payment options</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce comes bundled with the ability to accept major credit cards, PayPal, BACS (bank transfers), and cash on delivery. Need additional options? More than 140 region-specific gateways integrate with WooCommerce, including popular choices like Stripe, Authorize.Net, and Amazon Payments.</p>\n<h4>You control it all &#8212; forever</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce gives you complete control of your store, from taxes to stock levels to customer accounts. Add and remove extensions, change your design, and switch settings as you please. It’s all under your control.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest risks of using a hosted eCommerce platform is what happens to your store if the provider closes up shop. With WooCommerce, you have complete control, so there’s never any reason to worry. Your data belongs to you &#8212; and it’s kept secure, thanks to regular audits by industry leaders.</p>\n<h4>Define your style with Storefront</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront</a> is a free WordPress theme available to any WooCommerce store. Along with deep WooCommerce integration, Storefront prioritizes speed and uptime while eliminating theme and plugin conflicts during major updates.</p>\n<p>Define your style even further by customizing Storefront to your liking or choosing from one of our several <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/storefront-child-theme-themes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront child themes</a>. It’s all up to you, and all open source.</p>\n<h4>Built with developers in mind</h4>\n<p>Extendable, adaptable, and open source &#8212; WooCommerce was created with developers in mind. With its strong, robust framework, you can scale your client’s store all the way from basic to high-end (infinity and beyond).</p>\n<p>Built with a REST API, WooCommerce can integrate with virtually any service. Your store’s data can be accessed anywhere, anytime, 100% securely. WooCommerce allows developers to easily create, modify, and grow a store that meets their specifications.</p>\n<p>No matter the size of the store you want to build, WooCommerce will scale to meet your requirements. With a growing collection of more than 300 extensions, you can enhance each store’s features to meet your client’s unique needs &#8212; or even create your own solution.</p>\n<p>If security is a concern, rest easy. WooCommerce is audited by a dedicated team of developers working around the clock to identify and patch any and all discovered bugs.</p>\n<p>We also support WooCommerce and all its extensions with comprehensive, easily-accessible documentation. With our docs, you’ll learn how to create the exact site your client needs.</p>\n<h4>Extensions galore</h4>\n<p>WordPress.org is home to some amazing extensions for WooCommerce, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration/\">Google Analytics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/\">Delivery Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\">PDF Invoices and Packing Slips</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/affiliates-woocommerce-light/\">Affiliates Integration Light</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-new-product-badge/\">New Product Badges</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keen to see them all?

Generally speaking it is not a good idea to have exceptions to your security policies.</p>\n<p>That said, there is now a filter which allows you to do it: &#8220;limit_login_whitelist_ip&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Example:<br />\nfunction my_ip_whitelist($allow, $ip) {<br />\n     return ($ip == &#8216;my-ip&#8217;) ? true : $allow;<br />\n}<br />\nadd_filter(&#8216;limit_login_whitelist_ip&#8217;, &#8216;my_ip_whitelist&#8217;, 10, 2);</p>\n<p>Note that we still do notification and logging as usual. This is meant to allow you to be aware of any suspicious activity from whitelisted IPs.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>I locked myself out testing this thing, what do I do?</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>Either wait, or:</p>\n<p>If you know how to edit / add to PHP files you can use the IP whitelist functionality described above. You should then use the &#8220;Restore Lockouts&#8221; button on the plugin settings page and remove the whitelist function again.</p>\n<p>If you have ftp / ssh access to the site rename the file &#8220;wp-content/plugins/limit-login-attempts/limit-login-attempts.php&#8221; to deactivate the plugin.</p>\n<p>If you have access to the database (for example through phpMyAdmin) you can clear the limit_login_lockouts option in the wordpress options table. In a default setup this would work: &#8220;UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = &#8221; WHERE option_name = &#8216;limit_login_lockouts\'&#8221;</p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><!--section=changelog--></p>\n<h4>1.7.1</h4>\n<p>This version fixes a security bug in version 1.6.2 and 1.7.0. Please upgrade immediately.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Auth cookies&#8221; are special cookies set at login that authenticating you to the system. It is how WordPress &#8220;remembers&#8221; that you are logged in between page loads.</p>\n<p>During lockout these are supposed to be cleared, but a change in 1.6.2 broke this. It allowed an attacker to keep trying to break these cookies during a lockout.</p>\n<p>Lockout of normal password login attempts still worked as it should, and it appears that all &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; attempts would keep getting logged.</p>\n<p>In theory the &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; is quite resistant to brute force attack. It contains a cryptographic hash of the user password, and the difficulty to break it is not based on the password strength but instead on the cryptographic operations used and the length of the hash value. In theory it should take many many years to break this hash. As theory and practice does not always agree it is still a good idea to have working lockouts of any such attempts.</p>\n<h4>1.7.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added filter that allows whitelisting IP. Please use with care!!</li>\n<li>Update to Spanish translation, thanks to Marcelo Pedra</li>\n<li>Updated Swedish translation</li>\n<li>Tested against WordPress 3.3.2</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix bug where log would not get updated after it had been cleared</li>\n<li>Do plugin setup in &#8216;init&#8217; action</li>\n<li>Small update to Spanish translation file, thanks to Marcelo Pedra</li>\n<li>Tested against WordPress 3.2.1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>(WordPress 3.0+) An invalid cookie can sometimes get sent multiple times before it gets cleared, resulting in multiple failed attempts or even a lockout from a single invalid cookie.

There are still some problems with cookie auth handling. The lockout can trigger prematurely in rare cases, but fixing it is plugin version 2 stuff unfortunately.</li>\n<li>Changed default time for retries to reset from 24 hours to 12 hours.

Northern India earlier this year. Everyone I met was raving about his Satsangs, but unfortunately he left before I had a chance to hear him speak.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to England I went to a gig in north London to see <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/samgarrettmusic\">Sam Garrett</a> who turned out to be a Mooji devotee, his music is beautiful and he mentioned Mooji numerous times during the performance. So the seed had been sown and I knew I needed to find out more about this <em>Mooji</em>.  I discovered his Ashram was in Portugal and there was an upcoming 10 day silent retreat. The retreat was in such high demand that places were offered via lottery.  I entered and to my surprise I got a place.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-127\" src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/montesahaja1-300x200.jpg\" sizes=\"85vw\" alt=\"montesahaja1\" />\r\n\r\nMoojis\' ashram is <a href=\"http://mooji.org/monte-sahaja/\">Monte Sahaja</a> in southern Portugal and every grain of sand is imbibed with love. He has created heaven on earth where those inclined can spend time to discover their true nature. The format of the retreat is to attend 2 Satsangs a day, which last around 3 hours.  It is  during this Satsangs that Mooji transmits to you the Truth. His style is wonderful, blending wisdom, humour and love and I found myself totally immersed. The rest of the day is spend in contemplation around the ashram.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-106 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shiva-300x200.jpg\" sizes=\"85vw\" alt=\"View from Shiva temple\" />\r\n\r\nHis teaching is simple and direct, simply that you are the Self and that you do not need any practices to achieve this, you need only recognise it. This appears too simple initially, but he guides you through the reactions of your mind to this Truth and as you sit in this space you begin to realise that this space is who you are, who you have always been and who you will always be, the timeless witness to the events which occur within your life and beyond.\r\n<blockquote>That which says:\r\n\r\nMy mind is too strong,\r\n\r\nis the mind itself.\r\n\r\nAn illusion strengthened by belief.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-107\" src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lotusgarden2-300x300.jpg\" sizes=\"85vw\" alt=\"lotusgarden2\" />\r\n\r\nHere is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ui3vIvymDE\">recording</a> from one of his Satsangs','When I met Mooji ..','','publish','open','open','','when-i-met-mooji','','','2017-05-10 15:03:55','2017-05-10 15:03:55','',0,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/?p=103',0,'post','',0),(104,1,'2016-10-12 15:09:42','2016-10-12 15:09:42','<p>Published in Barefoot Vegan magazine October 2016 edition.  <a href=\"http://www.barefootvegan.com/magazine.html\">Subscribe to Barefoot Vegan magazine</a></p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Barefoot-vegan-extract-212x300.jpg\" alt=\"Barefoot-vegan-extract\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-77\" sizes=\"(max-width: 212px) 85vw, 768px\" />','To Hell With Recycling I Want Reuse','','inherit','closed','closed','','10-revision-v1','','','2016-10-12 15:09:42','2016-10-12 15:09:42','',10,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/10-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(105,1,'2016-10-12 15:12:37','2016-10-12 15:12:37','','When I met Mooji….','','inherit','closed','closed','','103-revision-v1','','','2016-10-12 15:12:37','2016-10-12 15:12:37','',103,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/103-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(106,1,'2016-10-12 15:21:25','2016-10-12 15:21:25','','View from Shiva temple','','inherit','open','closed','','shiva','','','2016-10-12 15:21:47','2016-10-12 15:21:47','',103,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shiva.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(107,1,'2016-10-12 15:22:13','2016-10-12 15:22:13','','lotusgarden2','','inherit','open','closed','','lotusgarden2','','','2016-10-12 15:22:13','2016-10-12 15:22:13','',103,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lotusgarden2.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(108,1,'2016-10-12 15:22:24','2016-10-12 15:22:24','','When I met Mooji….','','inherit','closed','closed','','103-revision-v1','','','2016-10-12 15:22:24','2016-10-12 15:22:24','',103,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/103-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(109,1,'2016-10-12 15:22:59','2016-10-12 15:22:59','','When I met Mooji….','','inherit','closed','closed','','103-revision-v1','','','2016-10-12 15:22:59','2016-10-12 15:22:59','',103,'http://blog.calloftheforest.com/103-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(110,1,'2016-10-12 15:24:22','2016-10-12 15:24:22','I first heard about Mooji when i was in Rishikesh in Northern India earlier this year.\r\nEveryone i met was raving about his Satsangs, but unfortunately he left before i had a chance to hear him speak.\r\n\r\nWhen i returned to England i went to a gig in north London to see Sam Garrett who turned out to be a Mooji devotee, his music is beautiful and he mentioned Mooji numerous times during the performance.
